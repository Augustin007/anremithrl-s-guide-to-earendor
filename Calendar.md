A calendar compiling all notes with an explicit date given. Not intended to tell the complete story, but rather as a reference for how things intertwine. The real calendar beginning from 1st of Flamerule, 5420 AS, as events from before aren't covered.

Things on calendar
Moon cycles (added for benefit of Lycan players)
Main Festivals, etc. of different cultures.

People who have been involved in these machinations for a while. Many people reprising roles from previous campaigns.

Campaigns not yet added, but planned to be added.
[[Shadows of Calamity]] - No actual dates in the notes, but I do want to take a stab at precisely when it falls. The NAF is mentioned, which gives a very weak bound to the timeline.

The months are: Hammer, Alturiak, Ches, Tarsakh, Mirtul, Kythorn, Flamerule, Eleasis, Eleint, Marpenoth, Uktar, Nightal. In total these account only for 360 days, but a day is added at then end of Alturiak, Ches, Tarsakj, Mirtul, Kythorn, Flamerule, and Eleint.

King Aukun explains that they cannot hope to defend against Auril forever, so they must eventually strike an offensive.

It is too far north, and the open Deathwood pass is in the dragonborn territories, and the Aldarkeep pass has long been held by Auril.
William lets slip that he knows more about Auril than others, because he was at the Tree of Names three years before, and curiosity piqued, he tells them that Colossus was there too, and that they were on a mission for King Idros, whose kingdom fell to Auril and who is no more.

Vildara quickly tricks Torquil into giving up the officer robes for the region of Gnomes'helm, and then strips him of Greenclad status, claiming she should kill him for not being loyal to Tormac, and for his false ascension.

LADY BLACK
---
From 1st Hammer-27th Hammer
Lady Black begins her descent into the nine hells. She arrives at Dis, the outermost layer. She takes a strange creature from here as a guide, who offers her water. She sees them having fun, torturing dead souls here for all eternity.
Lady Black manages to convince the demons that surround her to take her to Archduke Dispater. She is terrified as his aura overpowers her. He shows her visions of the vast forces on his side. She finds herself agreeing that good will lose. That there is no hope. Once she escapes, though, she recollects her wits and talks to the people. 
She sings and dances and tells them the story of a little boy who becomes a tyrant, and how he leads his people in a war and into ruin for his own gain. How a traveler passed by who could have helped the people rise up against him, and how many did not follow because they were afraid, and there was no rebellion, and she says that it would have been better to have fallen in rebellion than to have lived in this state.
She gives a speech, and chanting "Kill the Boy", the crowd marches onto the Archduke's land. She runs and hides, as she hadn't meant this to happen, but the Archduke comes out and kills them all, a few escape, a few stand a little longer, but none for long and it begins to rain blood heavily. She nearly drowns in the blood, but escapes into the next level.
Lady Black bargains with Isendra, and convinces her to turn on the other heads with the help of the Traveller. In return Lady Black gets a vision of a possible future. 
She sees snapshots of other things. Hints of something more ancient than Tartarus.
