They recieve no message in return. The two find documents burnt in a fireplace in Aldros's room, and wonder what occured. They can't piece anything together, other than a name Lorien Vass. Sir Alden Caelar, Eamon's good friend, arrives at the temple from Lys Maran. He speaks with both of them, agreeing that this is strange. They head out to show the meager evidence they have, but they find a market has been set up in the region. They struggle a bit with the various locals since the Aka'lit are held in high regard.
