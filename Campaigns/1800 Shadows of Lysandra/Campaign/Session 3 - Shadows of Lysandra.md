[[Session 2 - Shadows of Lysandra |<-prev]]

Alden has to go, and doesn't go with them.
Eamon and Orris and Levar leave Lys Alar at Sir Levar's suggestion and head to the High Temple of Lysandra, hoping to get some information from the records about Aldros's latest mission. 
They are attacked by monsters on their way out.
Sir Tymon and his squire Varek intercept the party, bearing a message from Sir Markov, demanding Levar and Orris's presense.
Before parting ways, Levar warns Eamon to trust no one outside their circle
Eamon decides not to confide in Tymon, despite his initial intent to, and lies about his reasons for going to the High Temple. He refuses their help and travels alone.
Assasins strike at Eamon a day out from then. Wounded badly, he is saved by a strange figure, who identifies himself as Lorien. But not Lorien Vass, Lorien Sabryn. Sabryn was an exiled knight of the order, and an old friend of Aldros. He also was investigating the murder. Eamon trusts him immediately, recognising him from the funeral.
