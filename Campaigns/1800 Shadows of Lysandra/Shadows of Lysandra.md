#### Summary
In the islands of Lysandra in the early age of Shadows, a young man named Eamon rises in the ranks of the Aka'lit.
Eamon is a member of the Aka'lit, an order of knights dedicated to protecting pilgrims in the archipelago from the various monsters of Shar. They are respected by the people, though held in strange mysticism and even a bit of fear. One of the members is assasinated, and Eamon wants to investigate investigate. He and his squire investigations are interrupted by attacks from various of Shar's monsters. Eamon eventually uncovers some information about the assasination and tracks a possible lead to Crantaa, one of the northern islands, and begins his journey there.
