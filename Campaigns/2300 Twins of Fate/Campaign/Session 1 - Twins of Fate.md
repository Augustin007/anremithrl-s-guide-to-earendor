The two brothers are at the tower. Lesalog is bantering a lot.

Anremithrl catches glimpses of an incoming group and spies on it, managing to take one of them captive. 

After a brief questioning, he attacks the group of mercanaries while Lesalog covers him with arrows from the tower. They capture the apparent leader after injuring him heavily.
