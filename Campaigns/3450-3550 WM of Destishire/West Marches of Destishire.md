In the eastern forests, there is a path that leads most to nowhere. But to some, it leads to a strange town. Travellers who go find it are welcome to stay, but few can find it. Those who do often find they cannot find their way back out.

Is it in this plane at all?

This is the town of destishire.

West Marches
This is a style of campaign in which players mostly roleplay on their own. DMs can advertise specific sessions of mini-adventures they will be running in the setting of the town, and players can go if their schedule happens to line up.

A dozen DMs and over 500 players.

While some groups can be a lot smaller, this was run by the role-playing games club of UCSD, and hosted over the course of a year on a discord server. I volunteered to DM, but ended up dropping it about half a year in because it wasn't really my style, and in general I wasn't enjoying it, even if I liked a lot of aspects of it and the general idea. (I just didn't like the people much.)

Also not theoretically part of my world, but since my players ported their characters onto this for some time, and I worked it into the solo campaign backstory of Lorekeep, I need some 'version' of it in my world? I don't know precisely what.

We had a little discord bot setup that I didn't really touch so that players could roleplay with each other without DM intervention, and so that they could invest and work on building and working on buildings and other things in the town. There was a living community of the town. People working on, for example, getting a library into the town. 

Unfortunately I no longer seem to have access to the stuff.
