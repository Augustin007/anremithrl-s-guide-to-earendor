Duthrim quickly realises he is in over his head, having no idea how to find or track the bandits. It is his third day tromping around the region where they are said to be.

Here he meets a young man on a tired horse. The man seems quick-witted and sharp and knowledgeable, if somewhat brash, proud, and impulsive in his way of speaking. Duthrim notes he has a military bearing despite his youth, They speak for a bit, pretending to be innocent travellers, but the man quickly figures out Duthrim is after the same bounty and proposes they work together. The man hesitates and introduces himself as Jason, but it seems clear this is not his real name. 

Jason explains that he intends to trail the path of one of the food caravans that was ambushed, to see if he can find tracks or anything else. Duthrim follows. While Jason is inspecting the area, Duthrim notices something approaching, which Jason dismisses. The two get ambushed and Jason prepares to fight them off, beating one of them away with a sheathed blade. Duthrim forces him to retreat and the two run away and manage to hide in a small ditch, Jason pierced by an arrow in the escape.

The bandits search for them for a while while Jason guides Duthrim in treating his wound, demonstrating medical knowledge. Eventually the bandits leave. Jason and Duthrim trail them.

They sneak up on the camp and attack the guard on watch, dragging him away and asking him questions about the layout, and leaving him bound. They try to sneak up on the sleeping bandit leader and kill him, and open his tent to find half his face burnt off, his right eyelid forced open. He wakes up to the light falling on his face and calls out. They fail to kill him and are quickly caught by the bandits.
