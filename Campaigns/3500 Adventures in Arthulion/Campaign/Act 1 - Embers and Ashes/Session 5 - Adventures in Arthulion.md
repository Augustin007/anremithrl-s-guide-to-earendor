After some weeks of coordination and training, Jason leads an attack on an imperial garrison with thirty of the bandits. Duthrim believes it is a bad idea but goes with them. The plan is to steal weapons and supplies and money to begin funding the rebellion. It is meant to be a quiet and swift strike. They plan it for days. The main force of the men will attack a food caravan just as it passes by, drawing out the main garrison, and the others will swiftly strike at the remaining guard and take what they can. 

They watch the captain of the garrison leave with the main garrison as the attack begins, a bald young man with burns on his face.

This goes badly. The Garrison has more men than they anticipated, and they had horses stored in an extra-dimensional transportable stable, a technology hitherto unknown. The larger strike force falls swiftly to a cavalry charge while the smaller strike force is slaughtered to the greater numbers. To their confusion, the garrison is not without the captain. The captain reveals to be one of a pair of twins, and claims to recognise Jason, calling him the little lord and mocking him. Jason, Duthrim, Kael, and Rokan barely escape, Rokan having his arm cut by a large axe and getting trampled by a horse in the process.

There are several captives and Jason and Rokan agree quickly that the game is up. Kael and Duthrim head back to the other rebels and warn them to disband, while Jason stays behind, treating Rokan's wound. 

The rebels agree to each go their own way, and flee. Duthrim and Kael double back to meet again with Jason and Rokan.

Rokan has lost too much blood and Jason has no supplies. Duthrim and Kael arrive. He tells them to claim the bounty on his head at the very least. He reminds Jason that he told him it wouldn't work, but that he believes Jason was in the right, it was better to die fighting than to just hide. Jason tells Rokan his name is Janvar Naiyar in a whisper, so that his friend would know his name in the next life. Rokan dies to his injuries shortly after, claiming them all as friends.

Jason unceremoniously saws off Rokan's head and convinces the others to head back to claim the bounty.
