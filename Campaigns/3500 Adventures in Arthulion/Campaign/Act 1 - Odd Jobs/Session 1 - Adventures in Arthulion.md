Duthrim makes his way through the streets of Nerheim. He is not a pure-bred of Sonorous, so neither the locals nor the invaders see him as their kin. 

Duthrim attempts to buy materials to start a forge, having had no stable job since the Flameheart eruption, but his outsider status makes it very difficult for him. 

He tries to buy scrap metal from a dwarven broker near the dry docks. The broker pretends not to hear him until Duthrim places coins on the counter. Which the broker takes, but gives him nothing. Everyone takes the broker's side and he is nearly arrested for thieving, and is forced to leave the city.

He  winds up at Hearthstone, a small town. Few will talk to him at all, but he manages to secure a bounty dealing with some wolves.

He manages to kill them, but receives little thanks, as they see him as being Sonorous and a bad omen of soon-to-come invaders. They give him some food and money and tell him to leave town.
