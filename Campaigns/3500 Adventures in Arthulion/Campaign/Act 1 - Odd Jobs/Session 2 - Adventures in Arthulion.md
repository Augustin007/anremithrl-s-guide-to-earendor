With the little reward from dealing with the wolves, he makes it to the next town, Nalros, and seeks work at Sonorous Forges. He's not given money for the work. He attempts to complain and attacks the foreman, and is summarily  blacklisted from working at the forges.

With his blacklisted status, he takes what he can. He sees a bounty on some travelling bandits that have been attacking the Sonorous supplies and stealing food. 

He prays at one of the temples for Hadras, the leader of the Sonorous pantheon, to bless his journey. 

He camps north of the city, following reports of the bandits, and dreams of his forge.
