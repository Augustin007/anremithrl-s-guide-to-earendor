The “bandits” turn out to be less a criminal gang and more a collective of outcasts: deserters, exiles, and runaway slaves from the Sonorous Dominion. Many are scholars or artisans driven underground by the literacy laws. Many are like Duthrim, half-breeds. They strike at the food caravans in order to survive. The one they captured doesn't like them much but most of the others tease him about it, claiming he always falls asleep on watch and deserve it. Some of them seem rougher, more criminal.

Duthrim works for them, fixing their tools and establishing a makeshift forge. They are quickly allowed unbound and inducted into the gang. 

The leader, Rokan, was a former Sonorous sergeant. Exiled for murder. He seems a good man, though, and was the first to release them. 

Jason and Duthrim join the group easily. Jason, fueled by hatred of the book-burnings, tries to speak of rebellion, but is mocked by Rokan, who has no such hope. Jason challenges the bandit leader to a duel and bests him, forcing him to yield, and taking command of the sixty bandits, hoping to make of them a rebellion.
