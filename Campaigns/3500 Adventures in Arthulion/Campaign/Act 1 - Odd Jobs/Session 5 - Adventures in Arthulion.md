Jason leads an attack on an imperial garrison with the thirty bandits, having picked up more along the way. This goes badly and they mostly all die. Duthrim and Jason run away with few others, who agree to go separate ways. 

Duthrim and Jason, without supplies, having abandoned camp, decide to try to claim they stopped the bandits, to see if they can get the money, taking the head of the dead leader as proof.
