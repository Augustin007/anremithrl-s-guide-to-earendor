With the newfound money, split, they travel further. They reach the town of Beden. Duthrim attempts to set up a forge of sorts, particularly since the local one closed but is met with Coriquendi bureaucracy. Jason is able to get hired by [[Keran Yanel]] as part of a mercantile guard, and gets Duthrim hired as well. They begin travelling with a caravan through Nolorei forests. 

They have several conversations, and skip stones at the river where they stop.

Along the way, they encounter an upturned wagon, and help the owner, Noros.
