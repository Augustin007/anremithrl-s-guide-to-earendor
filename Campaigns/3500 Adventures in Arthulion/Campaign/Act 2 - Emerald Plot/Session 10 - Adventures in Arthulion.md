Duthrim and Jason work together to break out of prison to figure out and stop this assasination. They try to ambush Leraniel, but he's dead in his home, killed with a dart. Police arrive just as they are there, incriminating them, and they are forced to flee, leaving behind documents. They hide out with Noros, the old merchant they helped. He helps point them in the right direction, and sends a message to an informant. While talking with Noros, they realise who the target is.

Theriad arrives after his time at Nerheim. He is accompanied by Elara.  Duthrim and Jason show up to warn him. Lord Feanor III shows up and orders them arrested but Theriad demands to see the evidence and talk to them, and Feanor accuses him of being paranoid.

Jason realises that the assassin is Feanor and spills Theriad's cup and kills Feanor, claiming Feanor poisoned it. The guards take him down. Elara, who drunk first from her own cup, starts succumbing to the poison. Duthrim tries to convey the instructions of how to make the antidote but no one listens. Theriad is frozen in horror. Elara dies.
