Duthrim and Jason work together to break out of prison to figure out and stop this assasination. They try to ambush Leraniel, but he's dead in his home, killed with a dart. Police arrive just as they are there, incriminating them, and they are forced to flee, leaving behind documents.

Remembering the old merchant they helped, they rush to try to hide with Noros. After an explanation, he decides to hide them. He helps point them in the right direction, and sends a message to an informant. While talking with Noros, they realise who the target is, Theriad Keladri.

Theriad was a high-ranking adopted son of the king. He had gone to Nerheim right before the Sonorous invasion and gone missing. Elara, a young elven noblewoman, had secretly gone and managed to rescue him. They had spent the last year in Coriquend, establishing alliances and speaking against the occurrences in the Sonorous Dominion. 

Theriad and Elara are just returning to Nolorei. Duthrim and Jason show up to warn the two, and Lord Feanor III shows up and calls for the guards and orders the two arrested, apologising to Theriad for the disturbance. Elara demands to see the evidence and talk to them, and Feanor accuses her of being paranoid, provoking Theriad's anger. Jason tries to talk over him, but Feanor charms his mind so that he sounds like he is saying nonsense. Feanor smooths it out while the guards arrive, offering Theriad and Elara a drink. 

Seeing the charm, Duthrim realises Feanor is in on the plot, he manages to take one of the guard's weapons and kills Feanor and spills Theriad's cup, claiming Feanor poisoned it. Unfortunately, he is too late to stop Elara from drinking.

As Elara begins to succumb to the poison, and Duthrim is recaptured, Jason identifies the poison by the symptoms and tries to give the antidote, but the charm prevents his words from being understood.

Theriad is frozen in horror as Elara dies.
