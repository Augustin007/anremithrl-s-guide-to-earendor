Theriad speaks to the two in their cells and tries to find out more about the plot. The documents left behind at Leraniel's place have been burnt in an 'accident'. He returns to Jason and Duthrim and asks them where they kept the things they had found. He uses his position to get them free, and appoints one Anor to temporary lordship.

They go meet Noros again, who had kept the documents safe. Theriad uses this to discover the truth of the plot, that being a foreign influence from Sonorous. Theriad and Duthrim bond over having been displaced by the eruption.
