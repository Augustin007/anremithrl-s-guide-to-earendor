Theriad discusses with Jason and Duthrim what to do. They track down a lead in the city and attempt to capture him, foiling his attempted suicide. They are again attacked by assassins but Jason and Duthrim save Theriad's life. Theriad's guard conducts further investigations and reach similar conclusions, supporting Jason and Duthrim.

Lenor, Feanor's son, arrives and takes lordship as Lord Lenor II. He re-arrests Jason and Duthrim, and comes bearing a writ from Baron Mabry, styled inexplicably as "king" Mabry, confirming some details about Theriad's status and strips Theriad of his guard, and attempts to have him arrested. Theriad escapes and breaks Jason and Duthrim out and they travel to the source of these letters.
