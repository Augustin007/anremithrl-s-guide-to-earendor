They travel without trouble, and hidden, back to Beden, but are out of money and food. 

The trio help a local solve some riddles, and explore a small cave, fighting a mimic.

The guards and the trio find a variety of different jobs

Theriad intends to send a letter to his adoptive father, the King, Arathasi of Nolorei, but is delivered devastating news. King Arathasi was assasinated, and usurped by Baron Mabry, who is now styling himself as king, and is accepted except for some political resistance, mostly led by Theriad's estranged sister. Mabry supports the Sonorous Dominion and is urging nearby kingdoms to do the same.

Theriad locks himself away and refuses to speak to anyone. 

When Galin, a member of Theriad's guard and Theriad's old friend attempts to talk to him, Jason stops him, saying that he knows exactly how it feels, and that what Theriad needs is revenge. They set to work on learning more so that they can give Theriad direction when he's ready.
