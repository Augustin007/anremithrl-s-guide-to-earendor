Realising King Mabry likely is connected to the plots, Jason, Duthrim, and Galin, the newly-appointed guard captain, drag Theriad out of his room and head for the emerald shores, travelling by boat under false names, taking jobs on board a ship. Theriad seems mostly in chock. 

They get stopped by pirates, and the captain starts allowing them to board this ship and take a cut of the goods. Theriad unfortunately chooses this moment to finally exit the room and a few of the pirates recognise Theriad and the bounty on his head. This quickly ends up in a bloodbath that kills most of both crews, and sets the boat alight before the pirates retreat. Having lost anyone with the knowledge to guide the ship, (Theriad makes a new mental note to learn this before the next time he gets on a boat), they wreck near a rocky shore a hundred miles from the Emerald Shores.
