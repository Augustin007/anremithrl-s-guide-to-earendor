Realising King Mabry likely is connected to the plots, they double back again and head for the emerald shores, travelling by boat under false names, taking jobs on board a ship. 

They get stopped by pirates, and when the captain starts allowing them to board this ship, a few of them recognise Theriad. Theriad tries to attack them, and this quickly ends up in a bloodbath that kills most of both crews and sets the boat alight before the pirates retreat. Having lost anyone with the knowledge to guide the ship, (Theriad makes a new mental note to learn this too), they wreck near a rocky shore a hundred miles from the Emerald Shores.
