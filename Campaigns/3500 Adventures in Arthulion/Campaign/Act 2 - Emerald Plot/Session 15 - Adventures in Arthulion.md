The trio survives, and six members of Theriad's guard remain: Galin, Lenas, Hoden, Thalion, Serach, and Vorlin. Three other people survive the shipwreck.

The four and three other survivors and try making their way through the forest to a village. They are attacked by a number of creatures. They can see occasionally passing boats and soldiers looking for Theriad along the beach, so they keep him hidden.

One group of scouts does spot them and they are forced to kill them. Vorlin and Serach are killed in the ensuing battle.
