They reach a town and buy horses and begin riding to the Emerald Shores as fast as they can. It takes them three days of riding and most of their money. 

They arrive at the gates and camp just outside. Hoden goes to find the Arathasi Loyalists while Thalion scouts the palace. In the camps, conferring, Galin, Lenas, and Jason decide they cannot give him time to consolidate his power. Theriad barely speaks the whole time and Duthrim is somewhat concerned.

Jason, Garlin, Lenas, and Theriad, being the more educated members of the group, are sent to demand an audience. Theriad ignores the plan and immediately lunges to try and kill Mabry. This immediately ends negotiations as the four are siezed. Jason fights his way free and escapes through a window.

Theriad is scheduled for execution.

Appraised of the occurences by Jason, they devise a plan. Thalion and Duthrim seek an audience and attempt to run a negotiation of sorts, but are somewhat inexperienced in the matter and Mabry finds them amusing and unconvincing. He does not allow them to leave the palace.

Under the cover of this "negotiation", Jason sneaks back into the palace to free the others.
