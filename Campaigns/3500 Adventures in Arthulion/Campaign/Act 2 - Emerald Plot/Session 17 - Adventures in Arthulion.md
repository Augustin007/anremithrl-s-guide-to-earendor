Jason attempts to get evidence by breaking into Mabry's safe, but it turns out to be a mimic. Jason is captured.

Duthrim and Thalion try inneffectively to stall.

Jason is put in a cell with Theriad. Theriad is despondant. Lenas is nursing fairly bad injuries and Jason tries to save him, but fails, bolstering Theriad's despondence. 

Galin berates Theriad, which angers him, and Jason speaks about his own family, killed in the Sonorous invasion, and of having to abandon academia. The two bond a bit.

With Theriad's help, the three of them escape their cell. In an impulsive act as they get away, Theriad sets a fire in the dungeons.

Mabry hears of Jason's capture and sets guards to arrest Thalion and Duthrim. Just then Theriad, Galin, and Jason arrive. They kill two of the guards and capture the others, taking Mabry hostage
