Jason attempts to get evidence by breaking into Mabry's safe, but it turns out to be a mimic. Jason is captured.

Duthrim and Thalion try inneffectively to stall.

Jason is put in a cell with Theriad. Theriad is despondant. Lenas is nursing fairly bad injuries and Jason tries to save him, but fails, bolstering Theriad's despondence. 

Galin berates Theriad, which angers him, and Jason speaks about his own family, stating that he himself was once a noble, and his own father was also killed by a treasonous baron in service of the Sonorous Dominion, and that he burnt down his family palace to kill as many enemies as he could as he escaped. Jason talks about losing his sister. The two talk a bit more and bond, Jason is somewhat closed off, but accepts Theriad's offer to be brothers at heart.

With Theriad's help, the three of them escape their cell. In an impulsive act as they get away, mirroring Jason's story, Theriad sets a fire in the dungeons of his own family's palace.

At around this time, Mabry leaves Thalion and Duthrim and thus hears of Jason's capture. He sets guards to arrest Thalion and Duthrim. Just then Theriad, Galin, and Jason arrive. They kill two of the guards and capture the others, taking Mabry hostage.
