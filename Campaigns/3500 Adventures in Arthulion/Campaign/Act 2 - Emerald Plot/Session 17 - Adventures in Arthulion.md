Duthrim, attempts to play politics while Jason, at his order, gets evidence by breaking into Mabry's safe, which turns out to be a mimic, and Jason is captured. Duthrim gains a feel for the political situation.

Jason and Theriad begin plotting how to get out, and bonding over academia and the prestige and glory in it, as well as the purity and love in it. They science their way out of the cell. 

Duthrim tries again to talk to Mabry, but it is completely ineffective.

Jason sets fire to the emerald palace while Duthrim and Theriad corner Mabry.
