Jason and Duthrim keep other enemies away, whilst some loyal soldiers to Theriad come to rescue the day. Theriad duels and kills Mabry in the burning palace, before fleeing.

Theriad breaks into one of his old friends' homes and leaves behind all the evidence. He knows that for now he would be likely to be tried for killing the king and other such things.
