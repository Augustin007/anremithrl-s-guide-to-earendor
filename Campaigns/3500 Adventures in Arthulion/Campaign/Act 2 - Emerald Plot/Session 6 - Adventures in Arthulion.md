They turn in Rokan's head for the bounty and split the money, nobody looks at them twice. The three consider where to go. Jason and Duthrim wish to leave the Sonorous Dominion, but Kael wishes to stay, stating he has family there. Kael leaves them, here, taking his cut of the money. Jason and Duthrim flee the dominion. 

A few days later they reach the Coriquendi town of Beden. Duthrim attempts to set up a forge of sorts, particularly since the local one closed, but is met with Coriquendi bureaucracy and is unable to navigate the forms. 

Jason is able to get hired as a mercantile guard by [[Keran Yanel]], a Nerethi silk merchant who seems to approve Jason's anti-Sonorous sentiments. Jason manages to get Duthrim hired as well, as a smith for the caravan. They begin travelling with a Yanel through Nolorei forests, following the river Lel.

They have several conversations, and skip stones at a small lake where they stop.

Along the way, they encounter an upturned wagon, and help the owner, Noros, an older half-elf, who is following the same road as they are, and remains with them until they arrive at the next town, Taurelen.
