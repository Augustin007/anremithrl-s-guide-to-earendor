They stop at an elven border city. Keran Yanel is assassinated and Duthrim is framed. As inquests begin and everything is impounded, Jason pays bail for Duthrim, and begins investigating the mystery, trying to clear his friend's name. Duthrim meanwhile meets Leraniel, an elven lawyer, who helps him prepare his defense.
