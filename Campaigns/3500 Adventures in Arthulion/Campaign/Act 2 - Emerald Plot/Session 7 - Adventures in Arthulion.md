They stop at the Noloric border city, Taurelen. 

Keran Yanel is assassinated. As inquests begin and everything is impounded, Duthrim is arrested as the prime suspect, as the weapon that killed Keran bears his mark. Further reports recognise it from reports of the terrorists in Sonorous, who attacked the garrison.

The Judge Kenaralis doubts the charges and evidence truly point to Duthrim, and allows Jason to post bail. With the caravan impounded, Duthrim and Jason haven't gotten payed, Jason spends the last of their coin to post it.

With Duthrim released, they talk for a bit. Duthrim is told to meet with Leraniel, his appointed lawyer, so Jason goes to search for evidence to clear his friend's name while Duthrim goes to meet this new lawyer.

Leraniel does not seem highly amicable towards Duthrim. He seems to believe Duthrim is guilty and insinuates that Duthrim should plead such, and focuses more on the charge of terrorism in Sonorous, and tries to dissuade Jason from looking for evidence. Jason is stubborn and unfazed.
