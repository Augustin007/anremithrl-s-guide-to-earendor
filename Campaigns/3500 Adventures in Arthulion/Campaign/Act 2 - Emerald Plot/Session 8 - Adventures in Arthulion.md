Jason's investigation takes him to discover more about merchant politics and tax wars. Duthrim discovers Leraniel is working to get him in jail and that the jury and judge are all bought out as well. It is a farce to give the illusion of justice to the people. Duthrim tries to go talk to Lord Feanor III, to plea publically, but is thwarted at every turn. Jason is attacked by assasins and kills them. 

The two meet for a few hours and lay out their evidence together.
