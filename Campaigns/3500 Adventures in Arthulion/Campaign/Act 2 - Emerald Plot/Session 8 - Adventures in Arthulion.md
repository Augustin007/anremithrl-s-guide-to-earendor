Jason's investigation takes him to discover more about merchant politics and tax wars.  Yanel had been a prominent member of the Nerethi trade guild and had been proposing a total embargo on any country still dealing with the Sonorous Dominion. This was highly inconvenient to the Noloric mercantile guild, and they all benefited heavily from his death.

Leraniel gets Kenaralis removed for failing to be impartial and favouring Duthrim and allowing bail, accusing Kenaralis of bias. Kenaralis is arrested for corruption. The new judge, Morendi, seems to heavily dislike Duthrim. Duthrim wonders why the lawyer that is meant to be on his side would do this.

When Duthrim tries to investigate, starting to realise that Leraniel is working to get him in jail and that the jury and judge are all bought out as well, and that it is all a farce to give the illusion of justice to the people. 

His bail is nearly rescinded but Duthrim is given advice about elvish law by the arrested Kenaralis and manages to keep his freedom. Duthrim tries to get an audience with Lord Feanor III, to plea publically, but fails. 

Jason is attacked by assasins and kills them, they bear marks of the merchant guild. 

The two meet for a few hours and lay out their evidence together.
