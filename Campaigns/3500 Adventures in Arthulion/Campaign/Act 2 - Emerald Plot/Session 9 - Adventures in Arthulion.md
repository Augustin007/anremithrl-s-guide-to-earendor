Jason and Duthrim break into Leraniel's home and steal some documents, uncovering letters involving an agreement to kill 'that meddling human boy', the next day. which Jason assumes means him. 

Police shows up where they are staying. Lord Feanor III orders them both imprisoned after being shown false evidence they were both involved. Jason and Duthrim attempt to demand audience with him, to show him the evidence. Leraniel arrives and is seemingly able to twist their words in his favour. Lord Feanor III doesn't appear to believe them. They speak with Leraniel, who seems confused at Jason's belief that he is plotting to kill Jason, until Jason explains his interpretation of the letter. Leraniel laughs and explains it is someone else.
