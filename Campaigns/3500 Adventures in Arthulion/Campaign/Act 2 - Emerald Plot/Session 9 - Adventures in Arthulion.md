Jason and Duthrim break into Leraniel's home and steal some documents, uncovering letters involving an agreement to kill 'that meddling noble boy', the next day. The two assume that the 'noble boy' is Jason, though Jason refuses to explain much, and Duthrim asks him to keep a lower profile and remain on guard. They resolve to move quickly.

Guards show up where they are staying just as they get back. Lord Feanor III orders them both imprisoned after being shown false evidence they were both involved, including a letter with a Sonorous Seal. Jason and Duthrim attempt to demand audience with him, to show him their own evidence. Leraniel arrives and is seemingly able to twist their words in his favour. Jason outplays Leraniel at words, but Lord Feanor III doesn't appear to believe them. 

They get a chance to speak alone with Leraniel, who is confused as to why Jason would jeopardize his own safety when they were only going after Duthrim, and apologises for needing to throw both of them under the bus. When Jason asks about the plot to kill him, Leraniel seems confused, and when Jason explains his interpretation of the letters. Leraniel laughs and explains it is referring to someone else. He wonders why Jason would think himself important enough for the Dominion to care about him. Jason seems to panic and backtrack and laugh it off. To play it off as egotism, but Leraniel notices the sudden fear in his eyes that he let something slip.
