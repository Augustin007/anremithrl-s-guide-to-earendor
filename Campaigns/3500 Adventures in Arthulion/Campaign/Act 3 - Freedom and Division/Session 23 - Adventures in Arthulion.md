Falledric helps Jason channel his anger into debate and writing. Helping him increase his eloquence. He invites Jason to a conference. The two set themselves apart as being more abrasive and less cooperative than others, and Jason enjoys the returned feeling of prestige. Anyone who disagrees with them is swiftly argued into a corner by Jason's quick and angry mind. Falledric encourages this, and starts painting the other academics as enemies.

Jason begins paying more attention to Falledric’s lectures, where the dwarf speaks of history as conquest and scholarship as bloodsport. Where he speaks of following goals and of revenge. Theriad notices that Jason now quotes Falledric often, with the same sneering tone. 

Jason meets up with anti-sonorous groups in bars. He continues writing for the free thought league.

Lira visits Theriad to ask if Jason is all right. Theriad admits he doesn’t know. He asks her to look after him, then apologises for asking. She promises she will try.

Later that week the university hosts a debate on foreign trade. Jason takes the podium accuses the administration of enriching itself on Sonorous contracts. His speech electrifies the crowd but horrifies the faculty.

Lira invites him to a festival at the lower ring. He agrees, then arrives late, drunk, and argumentative. When a merchant bumps his shoulder, Jason nearly draws his sword. Lira tries to talk to him and he blows her off. Lira leaves in silence. Jason becomes angry and shouts at her as she leaves. Since he cannot go to the dueling yard, he spends the night getting into bar fights. When Theriad sees him in the morning he is bloodied and injured and passed out on the floor.

Jason is called for review by the academic council, Theriad, Methunroa, and Falledric speak on his behalf and get his penalty reduced. Jason catches a glimpse of Lira, but she leaves angrily.

That night Jason sits with Falledric in the faculty hall. The older man pours wine and speaks of how weakness disgusts him, how the world belongs to those willing to take it. Jason drinks and listens, claiming that this same weakness killed his family.
