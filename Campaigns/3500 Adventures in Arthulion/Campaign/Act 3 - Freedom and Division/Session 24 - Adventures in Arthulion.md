Theriad finds himself trancing, imagining the library, walking its paths, filling imaginary notebooks with equations. The figure appears occasionally. Methunroa worries he is not getting enough sleep.

Jason speaks with Falledric more and is convinced not to listen or talk to Theriad and Methunroa as they are academic rivals. 

Jason beats up another Sonorous student. Theriad is sickened.

Two masked men show up to the Free Thought League, submitting an anonymous column. Jason speaks with them in private later, and they speak about assasination and violence, and killing the Sonorous ambassador and his kid. Jason agrees to help them.

Theriad's experiments begin to create slight warps in space, and he gets a funding, and pays for undergraduate students to help. A few weeks in, one of Theriad's experiments collapses in itself and creates a sort of reverse-explosion, or Vacuum Implosion. This harms one of the students working on it, as the implosion tears through the eight inches of steel that were meant to separate the student and the experiment, and peppers the student in some sort of black metalic shrapnel. The student lives. Theriad tries to halt the whole thing. Methunroa tries to encourage him to learn from it instead of shutting down. To learn and be even more cautious, but not to run away in fear. Theriad's experiments with the shrapnel reveal it is a metal with strange antimagic properties. When Theriad begins explaining its properties, and how he plans to use it in future experiments, Methunroa nicknames it as Nullmetal. The two believe they can use it to finally run experiments and understand the inconsistencies Theriad had started to discover, and thus revolutionise the current model of magic and physics. They worry about the weaponisation of both Nullmetal and the Vaccum Implosion.
