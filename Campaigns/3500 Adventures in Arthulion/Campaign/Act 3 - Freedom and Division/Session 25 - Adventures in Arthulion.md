Jason scouts the area and helps smuggle the weapon into where the assasination will take place.

Theriad dreams more of the library. 

Lira tries to talk to Jason, one last time. Jason tells her that she's right and a good person, and that she shouldn't spend time with him because he is bad.

A pro-sonorous gang organises a rally at the Free Thought League, and they come in and destroy the stuff. Jason fights them off, concussing two of them and badly injuring another.

Theriad finds him after that, sitting under one of the broken clockfaces. Jason is trembling with adrenaline and fury. He insists that the Citadel is rotten, that he will tear it down brick by brick. They talk for a bit. Theriad admits Jason is in the right in a lot of things, but says that he's probably not going about things in the best way, and that he's acting irrationally. Jason ends up agreeing. He admits to Theriad about the assasination plot. Theriad knows that arguing philosophies will be ineffective for the moment. Theriad quickly points out that that gives Sonorous an excuse to invade the Citadel, and that assasinating an ambassador doesn't really harm them, and in fact even more likely aids the Dominion. Jason starts to realise his mistake.
