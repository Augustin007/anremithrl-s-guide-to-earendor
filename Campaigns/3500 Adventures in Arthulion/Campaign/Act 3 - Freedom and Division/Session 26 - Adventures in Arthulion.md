They rush to warn the ambassador and are attacked by the two masked figures. Jason tears off one of the masks to reveal the one of the twin captains of the guard who had stopped the rebellion, bringing the cavalry and killing Rokan. Jason attacks him, blinded by rage. The other masked man, presumably his twin, attacks Theriad. Theriad is tired and behind on sleep, and suddenly distracted by noticing a painting of the figure in his dreams in the middle of the hall. The twin neutralises him and steps in to kill the ambassador and his son. Jason realises he has to leave his revenge to rescue his enemies, but does so, stopping the masked men and saving Theriad and the ambassador and his son, but the masked men get away. They leave behind a note for Jason, calling him the Whist. 

Jason reads the note and burns it angrily, claiming he will not be manipulated that easily. When Theriad asks, Jason states that they're pretending to have someone that they killed years ago.

The ambassador thanks them both. Theriad insists on public statements to prevent the war.

Lira speaks to Jason, telling him that she knows choosing mercy was hard for him. He tries to ask her out but she refuses.

Theriad researches the painting and discovers it to be one of Nebelum, the god of knowledge. Theriad has another vision of the library. He names the figure Nebelum, and he confirms himself as such, and Theriad awakens.
