A forgiven Theriad decides to go to the Clockwork Citadel to further his learning after the emerald palace burnt down, and with it, the library. Jason goes with him. Duthrim begins a forge in Othron Ibrith, not far away. 

Theriad here meets Methunroa and begins working with him. 

Theriad's been having visions of a library and a strange figure working in it.
