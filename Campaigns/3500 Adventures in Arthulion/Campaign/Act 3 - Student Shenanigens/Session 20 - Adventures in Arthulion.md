Jason spends his mornings at the dueling yard, skipping lectures. His matches draw crowds. He wins more than he loses.

Theriad works with small manipulations of the fold metric, attempting to shift small amounts of energy by pulling twines together for a brief moment. 

Theriad eats alone now, unable to bear Jason's mockery of his 'softness', and unwilling to make new friends. 

Jason drinks heavily with a new band of friends. They speak of politics and a shared hatred of the Sonorous Dominion. While at first his band of friends are good people, he follows the more and more violent ones.

Theriad is approached by a group of younger students, undergraduates, who mock and belittle him, mocking the incongruity of his human biology and elvish cultural upbringing. Theriad ignores them as much as he can, but one time they approach him right after the passing of the patrol, and Theriad snaps. In moments he has them sprawled on the ground. He stops in shock, realising he was about to harm the kids. He flees from the scene.

Jason returns, drunk, late at night. He sees Theriad crying and mocks him, asking what it is about. Theriad calms himself and explains. When Theriad falls asleep, Jason leaves, he tracks down each of the boys, and beats them up badly, breaking several of their bones and threatening them.

Theriad dreams of a library.
