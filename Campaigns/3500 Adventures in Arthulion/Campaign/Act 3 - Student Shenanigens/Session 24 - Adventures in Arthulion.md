Theriad finds himself trancing, imagining the library, walking its paths, filling imaginary notebooks with equations. The figure appears occasionally. Methunroa worries he is not getting enough sleep.

Jason speaks with Falledric more and is convinced not to listen or talk to Theriad and Methunroa as they are academic rivals. 

Jason beats up another Sonorous student. Theriad is sickened.

Two masked men show up to the Free Thought League, submitting an anonymous column. Jason speaks with them in private later, and they speak about assasination and violence, and killing the Sonorous ambassador and his kid. Jason agrees to help them.

One of Theriad's experiments harms one of the students working on it, and he tries to halt the whole thing. Methunroa tries to encourage him to learn from it instead of shutting down.
