They rush to warn the ambassador and are attacked by the two masked figures. Jason tears off one of the masks to reveal the one of the twin captains of the guard who had stopped the rebellion, bringing the cavalry and killing Rokan. Jason attacks him, blinded by rage, while the other masked man, presumably his twin, neutralises Theriad and steps in to kill the ambassador and his son. Jason realises he has to leave his revenge to rescue his enemies, but does so, stopping the masked men and saving Theriad and the ambassador and his son, but the masked men get away. They leave behind a note for Jason, calling him the Whist. 

Jason reads the note and burns it angrily, claiming he will not be manipulated that easily. When Theriad asks, Jason states that they're pretending to have someone that they killed years ago.

The ambassador thanks them both. Theriad insists on public statements to prevent the war.

Lira speaks to Jason, telling him that she knows choosing mercy was hard for him. She tries to ask him out but he refuses.

Theriad has another vision of the library. He manages to ask the strange figure its name, and it introduces itself as Nebelum, and Theriad awakens.
