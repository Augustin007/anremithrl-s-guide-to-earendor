They rush to warn the ambassador and are attacked by the two masked figures. Jason tears off one of the masks to reveal the same man who stopped the rebellion, bringing the cavalry and killing Rokan. Jason attacks him, blinded by rage, while the other masked man neutralises Theriad and steps in to kill the ambassador and his son. Jason realises he has to leave his revenge to rescue his enemies, but does so, stopping the masked man and saving Theriad and the ambassador and his son, but the masked men get away.

The ambassador thanks them both. Theriad insists on public statements to prevent the war.

Lira speaks to Jason, telling him that she knows choosing mercy was hard for him. 

Theriad has a final vision of the library.
