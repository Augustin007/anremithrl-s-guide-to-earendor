On board the *Alendris*, under false names, they begin their journey southwards. 

Theriad's fevers return. He dreams of Elara in his fevered dreams. His magic does not return, but remains out of his reach. For the first time in years, he wears his sword at his side again, as he can no longer rely on his magic to protect them. Lorim and Duthrim discuss what they're getting into, Lorim becoming frustrated with Duthrim's newfound closed-offness.

During this leg of the journey, Jason tells the story of his relation to the Sonorous lords. 

> His father, Reneck Naiyar, was a general and tactician of some note, who had earned himself a lordship via marriage to Naemjen Tevell, the sole child, at the time, of Baron Tevell some fifty years ago, and had forged a great friendship with Baron Vorn. They had both granted him swaths of land in exchange for his services in the Chishean Civil War.
> 
> Lord Hadvar Tevell would remarry, and Naema would have a pair of younger brothers, twins, Navar and Levar, three years younger than Janvar.
> 
> Janvar was born to Naema and Reneck, along with his sister, Tahljen. He learned combat and tactics and mathematics from his father. He loved his sister above all things.
> 
> Naiyar had great respect for the surgeons of the military, who had saved his life and those of his men many times, and had commanded all his men to learn of caring for wounds. Janvar was no exception, and was further trained in surgery and medicine. Janvar preferred fighting, and wished to be sent to war, but his father did not wish the same life of war and horrors for his son and tried to dissuade him and encouraged him to pursue academics. As Janvar grew and learned more, he began to understand.
> 
> Naiyar was thus one of the twelve barons of the Sonorous region, even if he was foreign. And thus he was one of the eleven barons that Baron Krenvar Grellan approached when he proposed the alliance that would become the Sonorous Dominion. 
> 
> In this time, Janvar had begun to date in secret Grellan's daughter, Miranjen. This was a secret because they feared Baron Grellan.
> 
> Reneckvar refused, and encouraged the others to refuse as well. But tensions rose. Miranjen wished to elope with Janvar, to run away and seek protection from her father in Janvar, and when he refused to elope, Miranjen begged Janvar to convince his father to either join Lord Grellan or move directly against him, as either way she would be away from her father. Janvar tried to convince his father, but his father refused to do any move that would lead to war and assured Janvar that peace always found a way. When Janvar admitted about Miranjen, his father said that he would fix everything.
> 
> But in the end, eight lords bent the knee to Baron Grellan, naming him Great Baron. And Baron Nelen challenged Grellan and a day later his head lay on a spike on the walls, and thus Barons Tevell and Naiyar were the last holdouts.
> 
> Lord Naiyar attempted to negotiate a peace for some time, and stalled. And Grellan was conciliatory, and softened his position, and claimed them friends. And invited them to his palace. But Grellan realised it was to no use, that he would not have the great tactician at his side. Miranjen warned Janvar, who warned his father, who ignored the warning, claiming still that peace would prevail. Janvar called his father a fool and shouted many things he would regret, then grabbed his sister and left to flee with Miranjen.
> 
> In this time Naiyar was betrayed by Grellan. Janvar's parents died that night. Janvar, Miranjen, and Tahlia would have all escaped, but her father had found out about Miranjen and Janvar, and locked Miranjen in her room. Janvar attempted to go back for her, leaving Tahlia where he thought she was safe. Janvar killed his first man that night, and nearly freed Miranjen, but was thwarted. Miranjen begged him to flee and save himself. When he returned to the hiding spot, Tahlia had been found. He killed the soldier that found her, and patched her wounds, and they fled.
> 
> Tahljen died of infection soon thereafter.
> 
> Lord Tevell bent the knee soon after Naiyar's defeat, Grennel keeping his twins hostage. They began their conquering within a year. Those became the ten Lords of the Sonorous Dominion. Great Baron Grellan and the nine Barons.
> 
> Janvar attempted again to free Miranjen, after this, but discovered she had already escaped and left him a note. He was unable to find her. Eventually, he heard she had died at the hands of her father.
> 
> He named himself Jason, a foreign and unnoble form of his name, and took on bounties to survive, until he met Duthrim.

Jason had learned from all that that he had to do what was necessary. That violence was needed. That failure to defeat your enemies led to the loss of everything. He refused to repeat what he saw as the mistake of his father. For the first time, seeing Miranjen alive, he begins to take ask the others about mercy, about humanity in his enemies.


A week and a few days in, they stop at a port in southern Gol, near the Bloodwine River, picking up Lord Nerol in secret. He confers to them information they have missed in the meantime, about troop movements and the like. They cross the border into the Taur, and Theriad uses his elven heritage to gain audience with Singollo. The elven king and by Theriad's adoption his second-cousin once removed. They speak in confidence, and he speaks gravely against the Sonorous, and Theriad is pleased to find in him an ally. They meet Doros, Elwe's half-human grandchild. Now that they are south of the *Zirmim*, the Impassable Mountains, through which magical communication does not work, and in elvish territory, Theriad speaks with his sister Queen Lenier and her husband Erenos, and with his friend Hoden, who is now the captain of the royal guard, both to catch up, as Arithmorei's border-spells no longer allow ordinary messengers through and thus he has had little communication with them, and to appraise them of events and better communicate about expected support from the Arithmorei crown.

They set out again. Lorim wearies of the travelling but does not dare breathe a word of it to Duthrim, who notices anyways and sweetly says nothing and makes hot chocolate for her, which she loves.

Nerol is condescending to Duthrim, Lorim, and the crew of the Alendris, and generally a pompous noble. The others dislike him almost immediately and Jason threatens him and he mostly remains quiet after that.

They are nearly spotted by a sudden onset of Sonorous scout ships, but they manage to elude them after a grueling chase. Jason here shows that he did get around to learning some sailing after the incident during the Emerald Plot.

A few days later the last leg of their journey is complete, and they arrive at Neros.

Theriad carries with him, for the first time in years, a sword. His fevers have not fully left him, and his magic is just barely returning. He thinks constantly of Elara, and can barely sleep. In a vision, Nebelum tells him to put her out of his mind.

They arrive at where the king is staying in disguise. King Ravon recieves them in secret, naming them foreign scholars. He explains his fears about the Sonorous and how he hopes that the rebellion succeeds as he doesn't want to end up in a war against them. He agrees to send weapons and funds in secret. Nerol seems disappointed in Ravon's reasoning, trying to convince the others to not accept the support because it is not altruistic. Jason nearly strikes at Lord Nerol, but Theriad anticipates it and stops him. King Ravon III also sends a forty guards to travel with the group down into the Dominion, and a larger force to arrive some two weeks later.

Theriad demonstrates some hesitancy at the idea of going back, but Jason attributes it to his physical condition.
