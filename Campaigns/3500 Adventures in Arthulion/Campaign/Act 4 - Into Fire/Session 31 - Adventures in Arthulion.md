Lorim is angry at Duthrim for making her leave first. They confront each other over this.

They make sure no one has any tracking in or out. Because of the stone, a much larger and more thorough search is done. Janvar is leading this, angry and hurt and grieving and insensed. Lorim tries to calm him down, and he shouts at her. Duthrim stands up for his wife and Janvar apologises. 

Hesta is angry at Theriad for allowing the library to burn and saving none of the books. Theriad is angry with himself.

With Rurik dead, their main encampment gone and equipment left behind, with heavy losses, the rebellion is in chaos. Janvar takes command, claiming that he is has a right to lead. The council meet on the matter and debate him on the point, and his strongest opponents here are Maedh Korr and his brother Jesk, but Janvar has more command of the soldiers themselves, as the figurehead, and orders them in. Maedh and Jesk do not acquiesce, claiming he will simply make them into a new tyranny, and Janvar arrests them both. Lorim speaks to Jason and tells him he is being rash, his sides disagree again, Jason agrees, but Janvar claims that the losses during the evacuation were because of the council, and that they need to be ruled. He renames the council into his advisors, and reestablishes the traditional titles that the rebellion had eschewed. 

Theriad beats himself up over the lost books and tries again to have a vision of Nebelum. In his dreams, the library he usually has the vision in is bruning. Elara is trapped in it and he tries to save her, but he cannot reach his magic. She is crying tears of ink as she tries to save books, and the ink splatters across the pages, and she bleeds in ink and ignores him as he tries to get her out, and again she dies in his arms.

Janvar confers with them about the decision to strike at Lord Hadvar Tevell, who held the fertile lands and fed nine-tenths of the lands, planning to starve out the enemies. Janvar says to strike rapidly, before Neroshi reinforcements arrive, and they lose the element of surprise. The council opposes this, as it would starve out the common people as well, and Hadvar has refused to engage with the rebellion, historically, but was once a feared and respected general. 

Janvar does not listen. He tortures the captured Levar Raxen to gain more information about the logistics and plans an attack. The logistics do not match up with the documents of the rebellion and Janvar insults the rebellion's information network. Theriad, Lorim, and Duthrim privately talk to their friend. Theriad he ignores, as Theriad's approach to Jason is too academic and refined and logical, but Lorim and Duthrim speak with more emotion, and he names the two of them his second in command.

He still insists on the attack starving out the people. Meanwhile Theriad recieves reports that Arithmorei troops have attacked the Dominion in the West. Within this force Thalion, who speaks with Theriad. They have reportedly had conflicts with Baron Vorqet. In the north, Neroshi forces deal with Barons Ghifarn and Drogen. 

Scouts report that Miranjen is with Qivern.

Janvar's first assaults are met with the legions of Barons Rethen and Qivern, with little success, but few losses on either side. Janvar decides to use a passage through the great hills that Raxen informed him about. Janvar baits Miranjen into a parlay with him, and convinces her to hold back Qivern's troops while Janvar's get through towards the passage. In exchange Janvar gives Miranjen back the documents he took, which Grellan would have punished her for losing. The passage turns out to have once been a lake, diverted by Levell's complex irrigation systems. The area is swampy and illness spreads through the camps. A day and a half into marching across  the lake starts to flood as Levell redirects water back into the lake, and the army is forced to backtrack, trudging back through deeper and deeper water over the next three days. There are many casualties to illness and drowning. Food stores are ruined. 

Neroshi reinforcements arrive. The Neroshi captain, Galor, doesn't listen to Janvar much, to his frustration, but agrees that striking at Tevell is effective. Galor speaks with Theriad and is convinced to listen to Rebel Intelligence reports and strike at Lirin's Pass through a secret enterance only written about in one book that is among those the Sonorous Lords burn. Theriad suggests a smaller strike force kidnap the Baron Rethen, whose legion dwells at Lirin's pass at the moment.

It turns out that Rethen did know about the passage, and had it defended, but the attack is sudden and the strike force announces a success, restoring much needed morale. With the warning from the defended passageway, Baron Rethen escapes before they arrive, but the fortress is taken. Qivern arrives shortly after, to reinforce Rethen, and is flanked as the main force arrives shortly afterwards. The two legions are forced to retreat under Rethen, abandoning the valley, and Qivern is captured.
