Duthrim rides north and beseeches Jason, asking for aid. The two have a long conversation and Jason apologises again, and they repair their friendship. Jason seems to not be much in command of his forces, and Tevell and Vorn seem to be the two larger leaders, even if Jason is nominally the leader. Jason doesn't seem to like being called Janvar or The Whist anymore. Tevell agrees to send reinforcements. Duthrim remains with Jason, as he is exhausted from riding all the way there.

Lorim begins the evacuations. In the fury of trying to save people, Theriad confronts Nebelum in his mind, letting go of Elara and his guilt, confronting the actual heart of the problem, and realizing the truth, that Nebelum had not withheld his power, but that Theriad had withheld it from himself. The power of Nebelum guides him to Preserve. The people, the knowledge. Teleporting from city to city with the sudden influx of his own and Nebelum's power that he had held back for months, fully becoming Nebelum's champion. 

At that same time, Jason lays siege to the Red Spire, High Lord Krenspet Grellan's fortress. Grellan makes an appearance. He explains that before he left Sernech in Sol'kas, he left newly designed Implosives with Sernech, who left them inside the cities after sacking them. These could level the cities individually, killing millions. Grellan claims his own death would trigger them, and that he could trigger them by saying a word, and that Jason will have to surrender soon, or Grellan will destroy Sol'kas.

While the evacuations and the siege are going on, Maedh and Jesk defeat Sernech's armies and capture Sernech, though Maedh dies.

Theriad recieves word from Duthrim about the bombs. While Lorim interrogates Sernech, and has her rescue teams search for the bombs, Theriad restores the records that Sernech tried to destroy. He finds, as he is ascending to a superhuman level, he does not need to rest, and instantly memorises and process all the information. He quickly identifies the locations of the implosives from synthesizing the records and the results of Lorim and Jesk's interrogation. 

Vorn thinks Jason should still kill Grellan and is confused by the hesitancy, but Tevell, realsing his grandson is growing and trying to do the right thing, and steps in to help. The two enter negotiations with Grellan, insisting that he step down, and stalling for time, and invite Duthrim as the representative of the Outsiders. Grellan thinks Tevell is in charge, thinking he has figured it out and that it a play for power by Tevell, and mostly ignores the other two.

Lorim coordinates an effort to have casters draw the right runes around the found implosives across all the cities and contacts her husband. Duthrim, hearing from her, informs Jason. The two sneak out of the meeting, as Grellan hardly notices them, and set up the other end of a circle, following Theriad's instructions. Theriad powers all of these and uses the circle to teleport the implosives into the ballroom of the Red Spire. Theriad can only manage one more teleport after that.

As all is revealed, Jason claims he discovered the command word to activate them, Grellan's people start abandoning him and evacuating the palace, but Tevell attacks Grellan, preventing him from evacuating. Grellan easily bests Tevell, but Tevell baits him into enjoying it, and Grellan slowly breaks multiple of his bones. This is a distraction so that Jason has an opportunity to kill Grellan. but Grellan is about to kill Tevell, and Jason instead chooses to save Tevell, rescuing his grandfather. Jason tries to fight Grellan, but doesn't have Janvar's skill. Duthrim attacks Grellan and the two duel, but Duthrim cannot get the upper hand. Grellan bests him too. 

Vorn has his forces capture Grellan's evacuating forces, and has the mages set up a field around the palace, containing the potential explosion.

Grellan prevents Duthrim from getting to the teleportation circle with Jason and Tevell, who are waiting for him. Duthrim orders them to trigger the implosives and teleport away, but Lorim forbids it. Grellan stabs Duthrim.

She goads Janvar out of Jason, Janvar abandons Tevell and attacks Grellan, besting him, but instead of killing Grellan, begins beating him relentlessly. Grellan is losing the fight, but not all the way down, and laughs at Janvar, speaking of how dissapointed his father would have been. Grellan begins also to speak of his daughter, but Janvar doesn't let him finish her name, striking him every time. Janvar suceeds in pinning Grellan down and brings out a dagger to cut out Grellan's tongue to prevent him from triggering the implosives as suicide before throwing him off the ballroom railing, but Grellan notices how disturbed Janvar becomes by references to Miranjen and accuses him of murdering his own love. Janvar's conflict allows Grellan to recover a bit and he manages to shove Janvar off the railing into the ballroom bellow instead. Jason fronts again. Jason begins climbing back up and Grellan mocks him, easily besting Jason while Duthrim, wounded but alive, recovers his hammer and descends upon Grellan, killing him. As he dies, the implosives begin to glow, and Theriad teleports them all away. 

The red spire implosion, even contained, sucks the light out of the sky across the country for a few moments of darkness. It is visible as far as Sol'kas. 

Jason is angry that Lorim would bring out Janvar like that. She does not apologise.

Duthrim and Lorim return home to their children.

Jason steps down from the Whists. After negotiating with the other lords and some other countries, new borders are drawn. Tevell becomes the head of the Dominion, and will peacefully transition the dominion into a republic. He will be the second and last High Lord. Several of the other lords keep their titles, but Tevell, as the high lord, intends to make those titles obsolete and meaningless. Tevell thus founds Kilir, which will become Khili, the republic of new wisdom (Ki: New, lir: wisdom). Jesk Korr and the Outsiders are also in these negotiations, and a large amount of land is given to the Outsiders, and they name Jesk their king, and become the kingdom of Rhazuvo. The Outside Kingdom.

Theriad completes his doctorate in this time, perfecting the teleportation circle, founding a sect of Nebelum's church called the Attendents of Knowledge, who follow the principle of Preservation. The Attendants create teleportation circles across many major cities, selling teleportation of goods and people. While the teleportation does not work across running water, it does greatly decrease the size of the world.

Jason does not partake in these negotiations, nor does he return to the university. He does not forgive Lorim, and moreover feels that he is not really a scholar. The person who was a scholar was Janvar. Jason only ever pretended to be a scholar. Jason was born of the loss of Janvar's family and home, Jason was first and foremost on the run, and so Jason's home is being on the run, even if he has nothing more to run from, he feels he will be better as a nomad, pursuing adventure rather than academia.
