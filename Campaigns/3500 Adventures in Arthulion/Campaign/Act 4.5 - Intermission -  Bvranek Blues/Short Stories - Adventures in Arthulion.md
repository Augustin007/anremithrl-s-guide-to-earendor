#### Bravnek Blues 

Duthrim and Lorim move to the hamlet of Bravnek shortly after the Rebellion. Far from the dominion, as far north as Khazad, where Lorim's parents, Wilgar and Narbrin live, seeking peace in the country and foothills. Jolvin and Birkgar stayed in Bravnek during the rebellion. Lorim's parents are somewhat older anyways, and they move in to take care of the family estate.

Winter has just begun, in a few months it will be the Feast of Lights. Birkgar, who was two when his parents left, and is now four, is somewhat distant and far more attached to Wilgar, but even more attached to his brother. The two brothers are inseparable. Jolvin is eight and "almost nine".

Theriad helps them move in. They accidentally damage a neighbours' fence and sneak out at night to repair it. They get caught, but the neighbours, a younger couple, Harnvor and Irna, appreciates that they intended to fix it. As they talk, Harnvor asks why their children moved before the parents did, and admits to disbelieving Jolvin's claims that their parents were alive and far away, and thought the parents dead and that to be a story told to the little kid. They uncomfortably admit they were involved in a war, but give no details.

Wilgar laughs his head off when he hears of their adventure. Nabrin hears of this, and insists on inviting the neighbours over for dinner, and sends Theriad to forage the forest for a plant while she has Duthrim and Lorim begin preparing food. In the ensuing dinner, they get to know the hamlet a bit more.

Eight-year-old Jolvin asks his parents why they were gone for so long in front of the neighbours during the dinner. Duthrim uncomfortably avoids answering.

---
#### A Bear in the Pines

Theriad comes over a few months later. Birkgar is still more attatched to Wilgar than anything. Shortly afterwards, Jolvin disappears, thinking that Theriad's arrival may mean that his parents disappear again. 

The family panics and search for him. Splitting up. Asking Harnvor and Irna to help.

Theriad eventually find him in the forest, stuck in a tree, being chased by a bear. Theriad saves Jolvin, and Jolvin forgives him for taking away his parents. Theriad tries to explain a little more to Jolvin, and he seems to understand.

---
#### The Case of the Missing Lamb

Nearly a year later. One of Old Garoo's lambs goes missing shortly after Theriad's arrival. Old Garoo tries to accuse Theriad, but Birkgar and Jolvin defend him. The group help Garoo investigate and meet Renk, a young orphan girl, around nine years old, who ran away from an abusive orphanage and has been living near the village for a week, stealing to survive. Jolvin had found her and secretly given her one of Duthrim's knifes, which she had used to kill the lamb. Duthrim and Lorim wonder why Jolvin didn't tell them anything, and they find out that Birkgar also knew. They talk about communicating and trusting each other. Old Garoo wants to punish Renk, and shows up, and Jolvin does go to his parents for help and they talk with Garoo and are staunch on defending Renk, paying for the cost of the lamb in the end. Theriad uses his money and influence to buy the orphanage instantly and make it a better place, and offers Renk a place among the attendents, taking her in as an apprentice. 

---
#### The Duel at Cragshex Ford

Jason rides into a new town. His pants get torn. In order to solve the problem, he insults a rich man at a bar and challenges him to a duel. Jason bests the man and steals his pants in order to replace his own. He takes nothing else and leaves the town. 

---
#### Small Troubles are Home

Duthrim takes his family on an expedition and plays with the boys. They see a goat in trouble and rescue it. The goat starts following them around. Duthrim names it Thunderhorn after it tries to headbutt him off a small cliff. He works at his forge and is called to help fix a townperson's mill. The person cannot afford the initial price and Duthrim fixes it for free. He mediates a fight between Jolvin and another kid in the village. He returns home to see Lorim arguing and laughing with Wilgar while Nabrin and Birkgar take care of Thunderhorn. There's a knock as Theriad arrives. The kids off to listen to his stories while Lorim cuddles up next to him as the two watch Theriad tell the kids stories. 

This story notes that Birkgar just turned six, and that it is nearing winter, making it almost two whole years since the end of the war.

---
#### Feast of Light

It is midwinter in Bravnek, and near to the time of the feast of light. Nabrin works on the food. Duthrim tries to get some of the food but Nabrin scolds him and tells him to wait for the others to arrive. Lorim tries to get her mother to rest but she turns Lorim away. Nabrin is shaking from exhaustion but insists its stress from Lorim insisting she rest.

Duthrim goes to help Wilgar, with the preparations outside, expecting to be turned away, but finds Wilgar laying on the cold of the ground outside, needing help to get up. Wilgar is embarrassed tries to brush off the need for help but Lorim hears of this and forces him to rest while Duthrim handles the preparations. He stops and feeds Thunderhorn when he is done, who nuzzles him.

Wilgar tells Lorim about how important he finds traditions. Nabrin finds out about Wilgar's fall and is furious. Lorim has him convince Nabrin to stop working for a little bit as the two admit they're getting old. Duthrim gets back right about then, and Duthrim and Lorim take over the food.

Ilen, Lorim's eldest sister arrives, with her children, and a few hours later, Lorim's elder brother, Naphim arrives. The other sister, Quera, is visiting her husband's family this year.

Birkgar rushes in calling that the rest of the family has arrived, then dashes off. Theriad and Renk can just about be seen arriving when Jolvin and Birkgar ambush them. Renk quickly escalates it to a fight in the snow as Theriad laughs. There is a lot of teasing going around. Renk and Jolvin accusing each other of cheating by either ambushing or retaliating.

Nabrin accuses Theriad of not taking care of himself and not eating enough while Wilgar talks to Renk, listening to her stories. 

Wilgar is meant to be working outside but calls Duthrim to help.

The Bravnek midwinter Feast . Theriad and Renk arrive to visit. Jolvin and Birkgar conspire to tackle them into the snow. 

Renk and Jolvin mostly stick together and talk and Birkgar is jealous that Jolvin is better friends with her than with him even though the two brothers are always together and Renk only comes by sometimes. Lorim tries to explain to Birkgar to not be jealous.

Theriad and Duthrim lament Jason not being there too. 

They all get together to eat. Laughing and being family.

An ocean away, and in the southern hemisphere, Jason celebrates the Summer Solstice while hiding out in a Kesnan storm-cellar with some mercenaries. He's getting them drunk, but only pretending to drink himself. He asks them about a certain spherical device their mark has been using to get away.

---
#### The Bread Thief

A loaf of bread is stolen from Nabrin's kitchen. Jolvin and Birkgar engage in detective-work like from stories they've heard, and work together to discover Thunderhorn took it, as he has learned to unlatch the door with his teeth.

---

#### Of Ink and Iron
Renk and Theriad are at the current base of operations for the Clerics of Nebelum. The base has moved around a few times over the last few years. Renk dislikes this and wishes for a permanent one. Renk struggles with paying attention in her lessons and gets into a fight with another acolyte who mocks her, saying she's only still an acolyte because of 'her father's influence', referring to Theriad. Several also mock Theriad as a false prophet who pretends to see visions. She eventually returns to her home with Theriad. Theriad comforts her as she cries. 

A few days later, Theriad receives word that a copy of *The Twelve Symmetries* has surfaced in the Hatreth market. Theriad intends to go attempt to buy it, and wishes to take Renk along. The Council of Knowledge tries to deny him and insult Theriad's 'daughter', who thinks that's the end of it but Theriad is enraged and defends Renk to the council, notably to Renk, not correcting the use of the word daughter. Renk feels incredible pressure to live up to this. To earn being his daughter. To make sure he won't find a reason to leave her.

They take a ship to Hatreth. What was meant to be simple quickly spirals out of control. They have to contend with the Cobalt Order trying to take it, as well as a mysterious hooded third party and assassin, with an incorporeal right hand formed of silvery energy and horns sticking out of the hood. Renk, continuously trying to impress Theriad and trying to cement her position as his daughter, and being impulsive and wild and not having payed much attention in the classes, due to having more street smarts and not seeing the value in them, makes things worse and worse. On top of this, they are unable to contact the base, as the hooded figure somehow hacked the teleport and sending stones. There's a short number of skirmishes and Theriad struggles to protect her and whatnot. Renk witnesses a death and Theriad tries to help her, but Renk does not want to admit to being disturbed and tries to act nonchalant and detached, stating she'd seen death before in the orphanage. Theriad is somewhat concerned by her attitude. Towards the end, they get caught in one of the Chaos-Storms and Renk loses the book. Renk does not realise that she is more important to Theriad than the mission and attempts one last time to get it, and while she succeeds, she is poisoned, and Theriad trades the book back to the hooded figure for the antidote. 

They return home. They finally talk and Theriad did not know this whole time that Renk was fishing to be called his daughter, since she did not communicate that. If she had, he would have told her that of course she could be called that. That she doesn't have to earn it. That they're family. They and Duthrim and Lorim and Jolvin and Birkgar and Nabrin and Wilgar are all family. He mentions Jason, too, and Renk asks a bit more about Jason, knowing that he's sometimes mentioned, and Theriad simply calls him family and says he's a bit estranged at the moment, but family nonetheless.

---
#### Plane Shift
Jason beats a strange man who is using some sort of sphere charged with energy as a focus while outside in a chaos storm. Several times he tries to get away by opening a portal but Jason is using a staff of Nullmetal that closes the portals as they form. Jason does not kill the man but ties him up and drags him into a small shelter. Jason takes the sphere and uses it to open some sort of portal. He's forced to leave behind the staff of Nullmetal, as it closes the portal when he approaches it, and gives it to the man, promising to return for the staff, and saying he will return the sphere when he takes back the staff. Shortly after, a mysterious hooded figure, with a silvery right hand, horns, with bits of light blue skin visible under the hood as the light hits just right, arrives and asks the man some questions about Jason.

---

#### The Eighth Birthday
Birkgar's birthday. He's turning eight. Four years ago his life had changed when his parents came back. Now it had been another four years and he was eight. The same age Jolvin was when Duthrim and Lorim came back from the war. Birkgar was born when Jolvin was four. All together it makes a rather compelling case for the idea that auspicious events happen every four years to Birkgar.

He takes Thunderhorn out for a walk early in the morning, hearing Nabrin and Jolvin in the kitchen working on his cake, wondering whether everything will change this year again. He collects some pine-cones.

He returns. Wilgar is loudly insisting that his stew is perfect and no one else should change it. Renk and Theriad have arrived, bearing gifts from afar. Books (Theriad had taught both children how to read and write ages ago), and whistles. Renk brought a tinder-box exactly like Jolvin's, which he had requested. Birkgar accepts a number of other gifts, and drags his brother and Renk out for a quest on his own, wanting to make a camp and set fire with his new tinderbox, leaving the adults behind.

As the adults watch them from afar, making sure they are safe, there's a moment when Duthrim asks Theriad how Renk has been doing where Theriad describes Renk and Duthrim almost says that Renk reminds them of Jason. 

Later Birkgar comes to his father's forge and asks whether he's like Jolvin was when he was eight. Duthrim tries to reassure him he's like himself, but Birkgar wants to be like Jolvin. Duthrim tries to explain that the brothers are similar, but also unique, and that that's a good thing.

---
#### Tahljen

Jason being followed by a glowing and warm ghost of a young young girl. He's in a large frozen wasteland of sorts, hiding from large bug-like frozen guards. He doesn't respond to the girl's antics as she flits about him, and tenses when she calls him Jan. She seems scared by where they are and clinging to him, and he offers the barest of comforts. Jason looks at his reflection in the ice, burn-like blisters cover his skin. When the guards pass, he checks a map and forages ahead into a cave in the ice overlooking a cliff. He looks back, telling the girl to keep a look-out for a blue-skinned-stalker.

He sees in there a different form of ghost. More corporeal. Looking like she's suffering from frostbite. Body broken and frozen blood all over. It is Miranhen Grellan. She looks hungry, but does not accept Jason's food. She stays away, claiming it's some form of trick. Jason tries to convince her that he's not one of the tortures of this layer of hell. That he's come to rescue her, that there is a necromancer in this very level of hell that promised to help him bring the two back to life, but she disbelieves him and attacks him. 

The battle is swift, but Miranjen grabs the ghostly girl before Jason can subdue her. In his haste he shoves Miranjen away from the girl, throwing Miranjen's ghost off the cliff. As Jason tries again to help Miranjen, she proclaims she was right, that he was some sort of trick, and attacks him again, which calls over the guards. The guards find and drag away Miranjen the two ghosts while Jason is forced to flee. He watches the little girl be dragged away and realises he cannot rescue her, and shatters the glass sphere. The girl is suddenly yanked by an invisible force, expelled from the Nine Hells. Returning the ghost to the heavens, but potentially trapping Jason in the Nine Hells. 

Jason hears a voice compliment the noble sacrifice. He turns and sees a light-blue-skinned tiefling behind him, with a hand of silver. She tells him the resurrection would have never worked. He would have needed something stronger before he tried again.

---
#### Market Road
Thunderhorn pulls a cart of goods as they set out to the Rothgin market. Tools forged by Duthrim, Lorim's knitting, Nabrin's jam, and Wilgar's whittled carvings, all ordered last time the family was in Rothgin. Duthrim and Lorim are accompanied by the two boys, they sing road songs as they travel.

Five bandits ambush them and block the path, demanding payment. Duthrim and Lorim try to keep the peace and talk them down until one of the bandits steps towards Birkgar. In what seems to be a blink of an eye, Duthrim sends the man sprawling. There's a brief skirmish in which Jolvin holds his own against one bandit for a few seconds, from Duthrim's training, and the two adults quickly dispatch the would-be thieves, and tie them up. They turn the bandits in at the next town while Jolvin and Birkgar are impressed by their parents.

---

#### Devouring Dream
Jason meets a woman named Soria for a contract. He has worked with her before. But this last time she betrayed him, abandoning him at a particular point, and he wants to know why. When they meet, she is wild-eyed. She doesn't seem to recognise him or know who she herself is. She is expounding on the great power of The Dream. She tries to get him to join The Dream. Jason denies this. He tries to ask questions about The Dream and about Soria and whoever's leading them and she suddenly attacks him. She easily breaks through his wards and undoes his magic with an unimaginably powerful force. She enters his mind, and is surprised to see both Jason and Janvar as separate entities, resisting. While she is there, for a few moments Jason senses a powerful presence behind Soria. He manages to stab her through the neck, and she dies moments before taking over his mind.

---
#### Shadowhunt
Theriad and Renk are in the middle of the Nilos mountain. They've been travelling there for days and are miles away from a teleport. They're tracking down an arcanist Elorin Valthor, who recently predicted some incredibly strange results of some experiments but did not explain how he knew before disappearing. It had been meant to be, again, a safe and simple mission, which is why Theriad had brought Renk along. Things had gone wrong.

They pass near a cliff and Renk stays well away, afraid of heights. Theriad tries to comfort her.

They spot a set of tracks. Renk analyses them with uncanny accuracy, giving a description of the being's race, height, and demeanor. Only minutes ahead of them. They judge it may be Elorin.

The snowstorm looks like it is starting to pick up, and after a while, they stop in a cave. They notice the man that had likely made the tracks, and Theriad recognises him even with his face covered in snow-gear. Jason.

Jason and Renk are introduced to each other. Jason admits he's after the arcanist as well, and says that Elorin got mixed up with some 'bad people' that Jason has some interest in. Renk tries to ask about that, and whether Jason is one of them, and Jason says that it depends on who is being asked, but that he would say no. Theriad tries to contact the Council of Knowledge but is blocked, just like with the hooded figure in Hatreth. When they talk about it, Jason admits he knows who this figure is, but assures them that she will not be here. Theriad tries to ask how this person interferes with Theriad's technology but Jason admits he does not know. He explains that he met this person while in the Nine Hells looking for Miranjen and trying to resurrect her and his little sister. He adds that he is aware that that was a stupid thing to do.

Renk and Jason talk about Theriad and Jason notes how much he cares about her and how protective he is of her. He asks whether she's his half-daughter, whether Theriad has moved on from Elara, fallen in love, and when Renk denies being his half-daughter and seems confused, asks instead how he adopted her, noting that it is obvious she isn't biologically his daughter because he did not have a daughter when they last parted ways right after the Whist Rebellion. Renk tells Jason about the Illerns. Jason notices that she focuses in particular on Jolvin but Theriad stops him from teasing her.

As they approach Elorin's location, Jason and Theriad debate about the plan, and Renk takes Jason's side, the more reckless plan. Theriad tries to argue with her and seems displeased, but when Renk backs down Theriad stops her and tells her that she shouldn't change her opinion just because Theriad disapproves. Jason watches the two of them carefully. Theriad talks to Jason and tells him he knows Jason was trying to help. He says that he and Duthrim and Lorim all miss him and that he maybe should come by to Bravnek to visit, sometime. Jason hesitates, but refuses.

Before they can catch Elorin, they're attacked by a group of masked figures. They fight them off. Renk kills one of them, this being the first person she's ever killed. She's horrified, but Jason convinces her that it's alright and to detach herself from the emotion. Theriad tries to stop this but Renk doesn't want to listen, instead wanting to run away from the pain. 

They catch up to Elorin. He fights them, using a number of strange potions to enhance and heal himself. He has a strange symbol emblazoned on his thumb. He begs them to keep running, that it will show up. Jason checks some sort of device and states it is too late for Elorin, but there is still time to answer some questions. Jason interrogates the man about something which Renk and Theriad do not understand. Something about a Dream. They notice how scared the man is and how he keeps on asking Jason how much time is left. They try to convince Elorin to leave the mountain and to tell them what is chasing him. They try to ask Elorin what Jason is asking about. They try to ask Jason what's going on. Jason tells them to leave and then teleports away when he finishes his questions, seemingly ignoring the teleport block.

A strange creature made of warped shadows shows up and kills Elorin. It attacks Theriad and Renk. Theriad nearly sacrifices his life for Renk, wounding himself badly. Renk is forced to get over her fear of heights to fetch Elorin's satchel and heal Theriad. They defeat the shadow and camp in preparation for their trek back. Renk asks who Elara was and Theriad explains, and Renk comforts her father and wishes she could have met Elara, who could have been Renk's mother.

---
#### Stones on Still Water
Jolvin and Birkgar go to the river to skip stones during a camping trip and are joined by their parents. The two ask about their parent's past and why they were missing for two years. Jolvin in particular remembers struggling with it a lot.

---
#### A Hole in the Hill
Renk is studying several books, trying to track down some information. She had started with her freetime spent studying documents about her hometown and trying to find out knowledge about her past, which did qualify as knowledge, she supposed. And gotten sidetracked looking up the Illern family history as well. But then there were some rather interesting bits of history in the history of the towns and a few weeks later she was somewhat absorbed in studying the lost ruins of Drondain, which she was growing more and more sure, from the descriptions and writings, had once been in the very spot she had hidden out in and lived in when she ran away from the orphanage all those years ago.

She presents her findings and, to her surprise, gets approved to go research it. Theriad helps her deal with the logistics of the project and requests additional texts from certain archives, navigating the bureaucracy. He continues to deal with this but Renk convinces him to allow her to head out to Bravnek and start scouting the area, staying with the Illerns. We see Theriad exhausted and barely able to help Renk. Going out of his way to do it in spite of all of his responsibilities. Renk is not oblivious to this and thanks him for it before she leaves.

After arriving at the Illerns, she drags Jolvin into helping her, having him carry some supplies while she carries a bunch of maps and some notebooks. They spend the day exploring the area. Measuring distances. Marking spots on maps. Digging little holes to find evidence of older paths of the Aelum-shar river. 

Eventually, they find half-buried remnants of some sort of building sticking out of the ground. Stones of the right make for the time. Comparing to the maps, likely the bell-tower of Drondain. Renk tries to uncover a bit more and accidentally causes a collapse. The ground gives way beneath them and the two are trapped, though mostly uninjured, a handful of meters in the ground. The pack, along with Renk's sending stone, did not fall in.

They call out for help for a while, but eventually give up, voices hoarse, and hungry. 

Just as they give up, they joke about Birkgar never letting them hear the end of it if they die down here, as if summoned by that, they're beset by a screaming and bleating performance above the hole as Thunderhorn appears at the tip of the hole, followed by Birkgar, leading the goat. Thunderhorn tries to jump in to 'rescue' them and Birkgar has to tie him back. 

Birkgar helps the two get out. 

The family fusses over the two when they get back. Theriad arrives minutes later, having heard the news, frantic over his daughter. He scolds them for doing something dangerous. The two of them stick together. 

Eventually Renk shows Theriad her and Jolvin's find. Theriad is impressed and proud, and relents a bit.

---
#### Salt Cellar
Jason tracks one of Elorin's leads to one of the Velorian colonies. One of the Valthor estates has been converted into a library and contains an encoded diary of information about The Dream. Jason encounters Elorin's brother, Enas, who asks what Jason is after, and allows Jason to take it on the condition he return it to the library, and then inform Enas, who says he was planning to flood the library to destroy all the evidence, and that Jason was just barely in time. He allows Jason to take the book as long as he vows to return it to the library so that it can be destroyed by flooding. Jason considers it for a bit, and takes a walk in the library to consider it. After finding a hermetically sealed salt cellar in the library, he agrees to return the book and allow Elas to flood the library. 

He hijacks one of Theriad's circles to teleport back. Teleporting across the ocean. It destroys the circle, and Jason passes through the attendents, who try to stop him but forget him the moment he passes by.

---
#### Unbearable Weight
(Also titled, Breaking Point)

Theriad is pushing himself too far, driven by his visions, trying to understand them. He confides in Renk, about his exhaustion. One of the ideas introduced here is that teleportation still cannot work across running water, limiting larger scale travel, and that maintaining the spells is too complicated for most members. Theriad has to run around to do a lot of maintenance. At one point he has to fix an inexplicably destroyed circle that bears marks of having been teleported to from Velorian Colonies, impossible as no circles are in the Velorian Colonies and that's an ocean away anyways. The attendents there seem to have no recollection of how it was destroyed. 

There is a particularly bad mission, Renk is not there as it was going to be dangerous from the start. And he has to be rescued. His near death experience allows Renk to convince him that he needs to make himself more expendable and unnecessary. Able to visit the Illerns more often. To find that balance he always talks about. To study his visions.

---
#### Contest of Rushford
Jolvin is helping his father at the forge, learning things. A few days later, he competes in a forging competition in the Citadel and wins. When he wins, he's approached by a girl. He turns her down, thinking of Renk. Birkgar teases him. He writes a letter to Renk to tell her about this.

---
#### The Harri Contract
Jason meets the silver-handed blue tiefling. He greets her as "Lilith" and asks her what the job is. Janvar flirts with Lilith but Jason nips it in the bud. 

Lilith says that she has caught word of some events that need more investigation, Jason denies payment and instead asks for information about "The Shard". Lilith asks if that's why he's so interested in the dream, but denies knowing anything about the Shard. She says she knows a person who can help him decode the book, and offers that as payment.

---
#### Crossroads
Renk goes on an small excursion, buying some books, while Theriad is busy. She runs into Jason. The two talk for a bit. While they both succeed in their own fields, they're both different, and lonely. They're both more ruthless than the people around them. They both find it difficult to trust. Thus, the two get along well. She convinces him that the Illerns miss him. 

---
#### Midwinter Return
Jason arrives a few days before the Light Feast. Nobody else has arrived. Duthrim and Lorim welcome him as an old friend. Jason barely recognises the boys. He talks to Lorim, and Lorim tries to ask for forgiveness again and Jason tells her it was forgiven long ago. Jason asks for forgiveness from them, too. Theriad and Renk arrive a few days later, before the rest of the family, and Renk finds the time to tell Jason that she told him so. Jason tells Theriad that his daughter is fearless.

---
#### Red Book of Bharam
Jason picks up the translated secret diary, called the Codex of Ebb and Flow. 

He is confronted by a bald, hook-handed man who seems to warp light. The Hook-Handed Man seems unaffected by Jason's Nullmetal staff. The man warns Jason that Lilith knows more than she is letting on and could have done a lot more than gotten the book translated, and offers Jason an alternative.

He seems to know everything about Jason and Janvar, and speaks to the two of them, telling each that they he can have everything he wants if he gives up the other. They both deny it in unison, saying they've reached an understanding, and that they don't trust the man. They state that they're pursuing their goals, and intend to use The Dream for it. 

The Hook-Handed Man seems intrigued by this decision, and explains that he can do nothing without a sacrifice. He continues to needle Jason and Janvar. The two agree to try to kill the man, as he is unnerving, but even though he is standing perfectly still, they find themselves unable to land a hit on him and stop in sheer confusion after two attempts. He continues to talk to them calmly as if nothing happened. He disappears at some point and Jason and Janvar cannot figure out or agree when he did it. They did not notice it happen even while he was right in front of them and they were talking to him. They start to doubt whether he was even there at all. An indentation of the hook in the table is the only evidence that remains.

They return to Veloria and put the book in the Salt Cellar, then informs Elas Valthor. Valthor pours a potion into the river and in moments it floods, flooding the library, and the entire colony. Killing thousands. Janvar is enraged and kills Elas, but Jason takes over before he goes farther, and leaves Elas's wife and young son alone.

#### Bravnek Blues (Reprise)
As Theriad makes himself more and more redundant, he has more and more free time. And his visits to the Illern household become more frequent, to the point he buys a small house near the Illern's to keep his things in, at first, and to not bother them all the time.

And there isn't a single point in which he and Renk move in. More and more of their stuff accumulate there. Their visits become longer and longer and more and more frequent until the word home brings to their mind that little building in Bravnek.

Renk takes to Bravnek. Finally feeling like she belonged, if only a bit. Heading most days out to see Jolvin. Laughing and roughhousing with him and going on walks, the two exchanging poems and little carvings and gifts.

Wilgar starts mistaking Jolvin for Naphim. He sometimes forgets who Renk is, or Theriad. And one day Renk asks Theriad if they can heal him, but Theriad admits no cure is known for age and time.

Jolvin and Renk often headed out to the river. Spending time together. One day, Birkgar follows them in secret. Renk notices him in secret and suggests to Jolvin to try to lose him, fording the river and preventing him from crossing without revealing himself by keeping an eye on the ford as they go. Birkgar tries to cross the river somewhere else in order to continue to spy on them and gets swept away by the rapids. Jolvin dives in after his brother and stops him from being swept away, but can't make it back to the shore. Renk rescues the two of them and grabs them in a hug.

Later, as they warm up, Duthrim tries to ask what happened and Birkgar admits his jealousy. Jolvin makes up with his brother and explains that she wouldn't replace him. With Theriad, later, Renk blames herself for the accident and for Jolvin almost dying, again, and feels like she's just trouble for the Illerns, but Theriad reassures her that she's not, that things happen, and that they don't feel like she's trouble, and that Jolvin doesn't suddenly hate her. He promises that it won't happen.

#### Moonlit Ball
Theriad's visions have been approved by the Council of Knowledge, and he is accepted as the new chosen champion of Nebelum. This has also come with some more formal duties, with varying degrees of tradition, and the formalisation of the Attendants as a branch of the Scholars of Nebelum. 

One of these duties, foisted on to him by one Queios Fabroscar, is the hosting of the annual Assembly of Bright Minds. And since Theriad is hosting, Renk is expected to actually attend this year. And to wear something nice. And formal. And for all her attempts at wriggling out of it, she knows it to be important to her father, and agrees to go, and Theriad allows her to bring one person with her to make it bearable and to 'suffer with her'.

So of course, she chooses Jolvin.

Jolvin arrives at their front door at the appointed time, wearing formal robes, and Theriad greets him and explains that Renk has taken a sudden interest in her appearance and decided to lock herself in her room in out of shame. Theriad tries to calm Jolvin's obvious nerves before coaxing Renk out of her room. Renk thinks she looks horrible but Jolvin is blown away by Renk's appearance. They flirt lightly and Theriad tries to hide his smile behind a cough.

They take a teleport circle to the center of the court itself and are announced. They're early, as Theriad is hosting, and the two talk in the corner and Renk gives him a tour of the area. The event begins, and announcements and talks are given by dozens of scholars, including Renk on her work as a historian and archeologist. Jolvin is super impressed seeing the academic side of Renk he had never seen as she talks with scholars and others. He also meets some metallurgic scholars and is fascinated by some of their work, and Renk finds herself watching him as he discovers the beauty of academia that she discovered years ago.

They eventually begin the dances. And Renk asks Jolvin to the dance because he's "too stupid to know he has to ask her" (As one of Renk's friends teases), and Jolvin does not know the formal dances and she awkwardly tries to teach him on the fly, and they stumble and bump into people and laugh. Renk catches him staring at her several times.

Jolvin offers to go with her again next year, and to know the dances by then, inviting her to that future dance. 

Later Theriad catches the two of them on a balcony, Renk's head on Jolvin's shoulder, the two talking softly. He watches Renk leave a kiss on Jolvin's cheek, and smiles.

#### Fire
Birkgar is, at this point, thirteen.

Theriad and Renk happen to be away on a mission, and Jolvin, Duthrim, and Lorim are at Rothgin, and Birkgar stays behind to take care of Wilgar, Nabrin, and Thunderhorn, when a spark and wind sets off the dry stores and the western cottages of Braknek. Within moments quite a lot is burning. Birkgar happens to be caught in this while walking Thunderhorn and keeps his head. As people panic and scream, he starts running from door to door, warning people as he runs away from the fire, and starts ordering panicked people into some modicum of order and plan. People obey his sudden fierce command. One man tries to stop him and he ignores the man. He can hear his father's words in his head, teaching him how to command. He sends some people to use the teleport gates before they burn down so they can call the Fire-mages, and uses his key into his father's forge to take out more buckets from the forge and start a bucket brigade.

Moments later the mages arrive, six people in red robes. Runes blazing. Walking into the fire, absorbing it, bending it to their will. They give new orders to the spontaneous bucket brigade and Birkgar makes sure that the orders are followed, obeying their every command, giving them as much information as he can. He watches in awe as they quickly contain the fire. He dashes into a building to save a young child, getting a burn on his forearm.

Elnara Flint-hand, the captain of the group that had arrived, commends him for his work, telling him he likely saved the city, commending his fearlessness and command. 

When he returns home, Nabrin tends to his burn, telling him they're all proud of him. He says that he wants to join the Fire-mages, that he wants to see them again. He makes a joke about setting the city on fire to see them again, but apologizes immediately and admits that it wasn't funny, and Nabrin scolds him, but lets him off the hook. He falls asleep very quickly, exhausted.

---
#### Heart to Heart
Lorim brings some food to her father. Wilgar is struggling with moving. Wilgar doesn't recognise Lorim and thanks the 'kind stranger' for bringing him some food. Lorim tries to explain and Wilgar sort of remembers Nabrin and asks if she's Nabrin's sister, since she looks like Nabrin a bit. He seems surprised at the food a moment later and Lorim breaks down crying, which only gets worse when Wilgar tries to comfort her. Duthrim takes her aside and Nabrin goes in to get Wilgar to eat. Renk is disturbed watching this, and Jolvin sees it.

Jolvin asks Renk out on a hike up the Khazadi foothills. She is scared of the height but doesn't want to tell him. Thunderhorn follows them out and Jolvin decides to allow it. Birkgar is busy studying the basics of fire-magic, wanting to become a fire-mage and is not walking Thunderhorn as often. Jolvin plans to take her to 'his spot', a little clearing on a cliff overlooking the whole village from a few miles over it. They pass a narrow overlook and Renk backs up into Thunderhorn trying to stay away from it, and cannot convince herself to pass through it. They're not even a quarter of the way there. Jolvin realises she's scared of heights and tries to lie and say they are there already and don't have to pass that anyway, but Renk sees through it. He holds her in a hug, pressing her head against his chest, and comforts her as she admits her fear. She tries to convince him that she does want to keep on going and that she can do it while holding his hand, and while they get past that one pass, Jolvin asks if she's sure after it and Renk breaks down. The two spend some time up there and he helps her face her fear again on the way back down. 

Theriad and Renk talk later. Theriad tells her he is proud of her for facing the fear and that maybe someday she'll be able to make it to that spot with Jolvin, but Renk says that she'd not do it until she could manage a teleport. Renk also admits her worry about Wilgar, and Theriad comforts her by telling her that Nabrin was still able to get through to him afterwards, and that while there is no cure, he's not all gone yet.

---
#### Promise
Renk spends more and more time with Jolvin, and the two had whisper quiet a lot of loving things into each other's ears. She often sits in the forge, the pair trying fruitlessly to study and work whilst constantly stopping to stare at each other until Duthrim has to ban her from the forge. And they often stay out late and they begin saying to each other that they will get married. 

Renk's father is again busy with some council matters. The visions of Nebelum becoming unclear and difficult to interpret. Birkgar, who was once or twice sent to watch them, is getting more and more involved in his studies, and in particular mastering the fire-stone that Theriad had obtained for him. And alltogether it afforded them no shortage of time alone, which they gladly siezed.

Jolvin speaks to Theriad and studies Renk's papers, and he learns more about the past and her area of study, and has a pair of rings engraved with a particularly old love poem, in its original language, that Renk had found in the ruins he had helped her discover, and that she had translated. And he planned to propose soon, and Renk knew easily (for knowing things was her specialty), and awaited with apprehension.

Then the summons arrive. A think envelope. Sealed in the deep blue of the Attendents. A twelve pointed star. A mission of the highest order. And Theriad had hardly told her that they were summoned, for a mission that could take months, or even years, that she fled without hearing more, and found herself in Jolvin's arms. 

She tells Jolvin the pieces she knows. That they are to leave tonight. That Nebelum's visions were becoming stronger and more erratic. That the structure of the planes is shifting, thinning. That it will be thousands of years before another opportunity arose. She had not thought it would involve her, but her father is the Champion. She'd taken up position as the Champion's Second because she wants to stay at her father's side, and because the order matters to her, but now she's doubting. She wants to serve, but she does not want to leave Jolvin. Jolvin lets her cry, then talks to her, promising he'll wait, and proposes to her, giving her the ring. He promises he'll love her no matter what she chooses, but explains that he knows the order is where she ended up being accepted after not having a family her whole life. The Illerns too, but also the order, and that she doesn't want to choose and she doesn't have to. That he knows that going is important to her, that if she stays, she'll sometimes have to go on missions, dangerous ones, and he'll always wait for her. Or go with her if he can. And makes her promise that she'll stay safe and wait for him. She trusts him to not abandon her, and reflects that she wouldn't have felt secure making that decision a few years ago. She then says that she'll consider leaving the attendants after this last mission, because as much as her father matters, and she wants to be with him, she *wants* to choose Jolvin, 

They stay alone as long as they can, falling asleep together, until night starts to fall and Renk bids him goodbye and returns to Theriad, and agrees to go, wearing the new ring, and tells him it will be her last mission with the attendants. Theriad accepts this decision, and affirms that he is proud of her and will always be her father all the same.

---
#### Ember Road
Birkgar recieves a letter from the Fire-Mages. It names Birkgar as a candidate for the Apprentice Examination. Jolvin is proud of him. Duthrim goes with Birkgar to the citadel. He could have gone alone, but Duthrim was very insistent. 

The teleportation circles almost everywhere are down, since Theriad is away. Duthrim knows Theriad is safe, since Jolvin and Renk speak nearly every day by Seon. But they need to go by cart, and it takes nearly a week. Birkgar continues to study and practice throughout, and Duthrim, who knows nothing of magic, and knows flame only in the forge, can only watch in awe as Birkgar uses the fire-gem. 

Birkgar sees now the Citadel for the first time since he is a kid. He's in awe. He's a little overwhelmed. But he keeps his head.

He enters the hall, leaving Duthrim waiting out on Ember Road. 

There's a written portion. Theory on how fire spreads and heat and how to treat burn wounds. On potions and magical theory and different types of chemicals and fires. It lasts six hours.

Duthrim wanders outside. He walks by the university, where he used to visit Theriad and Jason. He visits Lira Tannen briefly, who is now a professor and married to a professor, who has not heard from Jason in years. He also stops by the Smiths' Guild. While he's out there, he sees a shorter, stockier man with grey hair, the older but unmistakable Tizmek Nen, one of the generals that Duthrim appointed during his time as a leader of the Outsiders. One of the supporters of the Korrs' banner. There's a moment of recognition and Duthrim almost wants to go and talk, but decides against it and turns away. He regrets it later but when he returns to that street, Tizmek is gone.

He reunites with Birkgar after the written exam, and the two of them eat and chat. The practical exam is next, with mock disasters, command of fire through fire-gems. Birkgar admits that some have reached the point of casting without the gem, and is worried that his inability to reach that point will make him fail, but Duthrim affirms that Birkgar's command, brains, and fearlessness are more important than raw magical potential.

The practical exam begins. Birkgar excels at leadership and teamwork. Communicating clearly and keeping his head. He is not as bad as he had feared at the magic, if a little bellow average. He feels he knows more theory and has studied harder than most of the others, and has less fear of fire. He is confident by the end.

They stay at an inn. Duthrim keeps an eye out for Tizmek. The next day they attend the ceremony. The results are being read aloud, Duthrim scored the only perfect score on the written exam and the highest in leadership skills. The list of accepted candidates begins, and Birkgar Illern is accepted with the highest of honors, into apprenticeship under the third circle.

#### A Quiet Storm

Jason is in a tavern in Crof. He doesn't say anything, but people who speak to him have a sense that something is off and leave him alone. They find him hard to focus on. As soon as they look away they forget he is there. Something about him scares them, but when his gaze is directed elsewhere, they seem fine. His presence is strange and warped to them, a strange amulet is warm under his clothes. He listens. He hears some talk about a Karrish Sorceress named Bechel leading a cult of sorts. The Bharamites. Talking about a Dream. Conflicting accounts, some clearly made up. 

Jason gets up. The amulet flares and suddenly everyone is looking at him. He quietly asks the patrons some questions about this cult. They are terrified of him, and compelled to answer, completely and truthfully. He knows they'll all forget, but he leaves a coin for his drink in front of the bartender, and a coin in each of their pockets, all the same.

He leaves. The amulet is warm against his chest. He can feel their minds being erased. He can hear the tavern resume its conversation. 

He presses his forehead against that of his horse for a long moment. Then he rides out into the rain. 

---
#### Together

The job has turned out to be far more difficult and involved than expected. When those summons had first arrived, Renk and Theriad had believed it would at most be a few months. Some excursions to some other planes. Some experiments and an execution of the anchoring.

But for the anchoring they'd been forced to journey beyond the sanctuary planes, with no Ley Lines between them and Nebelum, and no Ley Lines to protect them.

They'd expected to be able to go back and forth. Small excursions, small sections done at a time, bringing more supplies, but plane shifting back through the Ley Lines was a lot harder than they had expected. Even escaping them had required Theriad's direct channeling of Nebelum. No one else can get out to them. They can't go back. They are trapped out in the Leth Pocket until Nebelum was close enough to plane shift them back.

It is a plane with strange topologies, infused with Telos's remnants. Creatures, formed by the Architects, corrupted by Atropus, attack them at every turn. Theriad protects her, putting himself on the line every time, and Renk trusts her father, but is worried for him. They hardly have chances to rest, or sleep. Visions of Nebelum grow stronger with the proximity. Telos's scatterred essense confuses the visions, mixing them with memories of the Eternal Wars. Each cision becomes stranger and more confusing, and Renk is terrified of sleep now. Terrified of loud and bright visions that overwhelm them. There is no air, they have to create it with their spells, and its thin and weak and wrong. Gravity is heavier. And time flows differently in the plane. 

They are trying to trace the Fractures in Leth. To bring it through the Ley Lines and squeeze some of Nebelum's divinity, anchored into those fractures. To shift the entire plane, even if it is small like this.

They communicate via Seon as much as possible. Coordinating with the clerics on the other end. Talking with the family. Renk has to sometimes wait for hours to get responses from Jolvin when she speaks to him. Other times he has to wait. Sometimes they fall asleep in those intervening hours. And sometimes they cannot afford the magical energy to do it. She is exhausted and numb and hungry and in constant fear. This is the mission that she left Bravnek for in Promises, over a year ago on the Material Plane, but she barely remembers what the material plane is like. And yet the other half of her is in a constant state of disassociation. Waiting. Focusing. Hoping for that day she returns. Hoping to marry Jolvin. Waiting until the next time they can talk. Theriad desperately wants to send her back, but they are trapped. 

One week, she hasn't been able to talk to Jolvin in days. He's been trying to contact her more than usual suddenly. She's worried, but they haven't had the magical strength to power a Seon. 

Then finally they have a long enough respite. They manage to power a connection. 

It's midnight over there, but Jolvin is up, waiting for her. He is worried for her, for that week she hasn't been able to speak. She knows he has something to say but he almost doesn't say it. She can see it in the illusory face projected from the Seon. And he admits Wilgar died a few days ago. And Renk stops and finds she feels nothing. She's too tired to feel. She tries to remember Wilgar but he's a blur in her mind. She can't think. She can't feel. She's too exhausted. And she hates herself for it. And Jolvin tries to comfort her, to ask how it's going, and she just shouts at him and stops the connection. And cries. And turns away Theriad.

---

#### Wax Mask
A figure in a wax mask shows up to the Citadel of the attendants. The wax mask is sculpted into a face with a strange bird covering the eyes. The figure talks to them easily and the attendants find it easy to talk to the figure, easily revealing secrets. They each seem to recognize the figure as someone else. Someone they care about, or love. They find it hard to take their eyes off of The Wax Mask. The Wax Mask enters their end of the Leth experiment, a device called the Leywrite, and the remaining bits of the machinery running the teleportation network and sabotages some things, and tweaks some others, then places a stone engraved with a strange mark on it on the Leywrite.

The Wax Mask comes to the Council of Knowledge, and the illusion fails, and they ask who this Wax Mask is. For a moment the Wax Mask has their hand on the hilt of their weapon and he threatens them. Then there's a strange moment of hesitation and their demeanour and identity changes. The Wax Mask speaks, and apologises for what they had to do and assures them that they did not want to do it. They prophesy that there is great danger in the future and that strange alliances may need to be made. They prophesy that Theriad will be back soon, and likely just in time. They warn about the sabotage they just committed. The Wax Mask disappears in a flash just as they try to have the Wax Mask arrested.

A team inspects the sabotage, but find it strange that they keep on forgetting to check on the Leywrite. With some effort, they check on it, and notice the stone that the Wax Mask left behind, but when they turn away from it, they all collectively forget.

The Wax Mask goes up to Lilith in a room of an inn. Lilith goes to kiss him but he pushes her away and takes off the mask, revealing Jason, and explicitly tells Lilith that he's not her lover, Janvar, right now. He seems displeased and tells Lilith to never ask him to do something like that again, and mentions his displeasure that the mask now has a Whist in it. Jason states he hates wearing the Whist. Lilith tells Jason that that detail was Janvar's doing. Lilith then ignores Jason and speaks to Janvar in Jason and tells him that she told Janvar to keep it a secret from Jason. Jason says he's angry at Janvar too. Janvar explains to Lilith that he couldn't keep it a secret from Jason, Jason started to figure things out. That when Janvar was about to kill the council when they saw through his mask, Jason took over and fronted. Jason asks Lilith what he did, what the mission was, whether there have been other missions, and Lilith doesn't answer. She asks Janvar, whether he can make Jason forget this bit too, calling Janvar her love.

---
#### Return
Leth is collapsing. Which had sort-of been part of the plan. It was easier to slip a collapsed plane into a new twine through the Ley Lines. But she is pretty sure they weren't supposed to be here, still, and the anchoring is supposed to be done already. And they hadn't induced the collapse. Some strange other force had.

The borders are becoming thinner. They have more supplies at their disposal, in theory. And more magic. But the Seons gave out months ago. She's been unable to communicate home. They're trying to get the anchoring right before the planes collapse. Staying out longer than usual. Going farther. 

Then, one day, the anchoring works for just the briefest moment, and they stay later and later, trying to get it to work, getting little glimpses, little moments. Renk feels nothing. Despite it being success. She's too scared. She cannot believe it. And then it happens. Fast. One moment they're working on it and then the next they're stranded, caught in a shard fracture, far away, and surrounded by monsters, and then Theriad's opened up a full anchoring for a small window of time and presses something into her hands, telling her to make it home, and the next moment the world tilts and she's in darkness. In Thoughts.

She doesn't feel her body. Her mind. Her memories. For a moment she is no one. Only her self in abstract. In a sort of dream sense. And she reaches to follow his order. Instinctively, without will. To find home. And two threads of connection lay before her. Two streams of magic from her heart. And one is Theriad and the other is Jolvin. She can feel one pushing her away, wishing her home and safe, and the other pulling on her, wishing her return. And for a moment she fights to return to her father. But she can hear his voice, denying her. Promising he'll return. To choose for herself. And in that dream-sight, she chooses. She seizes that connection. Claims it as home. 

*Jolvin.*

There's a rush. There's a tilt again. Gravity shifts. Time shifts. Feeling returns to her. There's a burst of unbearable light and heat. 

She slams into a soft ground. Hearing the foreign-seeming sound of crunching leaves. She gasps and then: Air. Silence.

And it remains unbroken until suddenly she hears her name. She hears firewood clattering to the ground, and there is Jolvin. Pale-faced. Tears streaking down his face. And there's a moment's hesitation before he decides he doesn't care whether she's a hallucination. He'll be there for her just in case she's real. And neither of them can truly believe it. And she tries to speak. To say something, at all, but her throat doesn't work and she lurches to her feet in the now-strange gravity. As she half falls and he catches her and wraps himself around her and simply holds on tightly and she sobs. Shakes and sobs into him. And he's shaking too and they lay on the ground, holding each other. 

She was sobbing again when she made it back to the Illern's home. Sobbing into Nabrin's arms. There was, indeed, a good deal of crying. And the next day she is frozen in terror. Unable to process. And Jolvin is there for her. And days pass and she visits Wilgar's grave. Then Thunderhorn's grave. Then Birkgar comes to visit her from the citadel, and she starts to realize how much she's missed because he's changed, and older, and courting some other fire-mage named Irna And the midwinter feast passes. And Jason isn't there, sending only a letter that he's mixed up in some business.

And Renk returns on edge. Ready to fight at a moment's notice. Seeming unable to believe she is safe. But otherwise seems fine, functioning. And she submits her reports to the Council of Knowledge, and she resigns. But she confides to Jolvin it hardly seems real. And when she finally calms down, when she's finally feeling like herself for a moment, something changes and suddenly Renk's scared of reality, scared it isn't real. Scared to sleep and wake up in Leth. Scared to dream. Scared for her father. Scared to be alone, to leave Jolvin's side for even a moment.

And a few months later, when she starts to feel whole again, the church of knowledge try to speak to her about it some more, and she's set off again, and Jolvin turns them away.

And she thinks he doesn't want to marry her anymore, not like this, but she risks it all and asks anyways. And Jolvin comforts her again, and promises he will. And she wants to wait until the world feels a little more real. She's scared it won't, ever. But she wants the marriage to feel real. And Jolvin tries to tell her he'll be with her no matter what, but ends up agreeing to wait. And sometimes she's angry, inexplicably, or sad. And things aren't like they used to be. And Jolvin feels like the connection between them is severed a bit. That she's distant. But she wants it repaired. And so he decides to wait. To help. To help her believe that the world can feel real again.

And then it does. Slowly it does. For moments. Then longer moments. Jolvin helps her get there as much as he can. And she starts getting back into archaeology. And researching how to save her father. She pulls some pranks with Birkgar. She goes out and hunts. She and Jolvin attend Birkgar's wedding to Irna. And a year later she accepts it's close enough. That the world is real enough. And time is passing so fast. But it slows down. And she makes plans. And rests. And another year later she's standing in front of a small gathering (for Renk still can't bear crowds), and tying herself to Jolvin.

She had hoped that night would be the happiest in her life. And she did feel safer, more real. But days later, when she told Jolvin how her connection to him had shown her the path back, when they were in their own new home, far away from Bravnek, but safe and sound. That day was more memorable. More real.

---
#### Midwinter
It's the Feast of Lights, Irna and Birkgar are visiting with their son, Olgin, who is just a few months old. They don't let Nabrin carry him, as Irna's innate magical affinity for fire was inherited by Olgin and he has recently developed the ability and tendency to set himself on fire.

Jolvin and Renk do not show up, though Jolvin writes that Renk would have loved to come but needs a bit more time to readjust herself before travelling and returning to Bravnek. They also write that they are planning to adopt the infant child of their neighbours, who died of illness. 

Jason arrives without warning. He assures them he was not followed and no one he works with knows about them. They are confused and worried by this assertion. 

He hears about Renk and Theriad and feels like he understands how Renk is feeling. He seems to know more about it but doesn't explain. He's elusive about what he has been doing in the intervening years. They are happy he is there and share food with them. He leaves just as suddenly, seeming reluctant to do so but ignoring their pleas to stay a little longer.

---
#### Contest of Rushford (Reprise)
Renk has been teasing him for months. Calling him the judge with exaggerated formality. And they'd shove and kiss and joke around. But all the same, they *were* grown.

And he travelled to Citadel for the Rushford Contest, just like he had years ago. But things are different. And this time, he is judging.

His wife is with him. And with them is their little gem of a girl, Vardarul, is excited to see her grandparents. 

They stay at Birkgar and Irna's home the day before, chatting away, watching Vardarul and Olgin play and run around. Angda, only a year old, starting to walk, toddles after them and rams into walls. Duthrim and Lorim arrive late in the day. Nabrin did not make the journey, as she was getting too old.

And they set out, leaving Vardarul with her grandparents. Jolvin wears the traditional Smith's mantle, straightened and re-dyed just for the occasion. Renk is wearing a deep green cloak, mottled and lumpy and unstraightened, despite Jolvin's best attempts. He's secretly glad she put up a fight against putting in effort about her appearance, as a few years ago she might have mechanically obeyed. It feels more *her*. But he cannot say that. 

The forges roar for hours and Jolvin watches the forging. Renk stays in a corner, away from the light and crowds, encased in a small spell against the noise, but watching her husband with love and pride. 

---

#### Spiral
Jason is in a strange enormous cave laboratory with a goliath that he calls Koluss. Jason is standing atop an enormous table surrounded by dead bodies, impaled, dripping blood into enormous jars. Jason seems disgusted by the bodies around him, but Koluss laughs, saying that Jason still wants his services all the same. 

Jason acquiesces and gives Koluss a bag containing the payment that the Den wants. Some collection of documents. He vows to come after the Ashdilkir and the Den eventually and Koluss laughs. Koluss withdraws a tiny metal spike from a jar of blood, and stabs it into Jason's chest. The wound closes instantly and heals over the metal spike, leaving it embedded in Jason's chest. Jason thanks Koluss. He laments it couldn't be an earring like what Elorin did because the Bharamites would know about it this time.

Right after leaving Koluss's lair, some Bharamites appear and they capture him and take him to a strange spiral pool in a cave. They claim that though he has figured out how to resist their lesser minds, he cannot resist the pool. The pool is filled with some strange sort of great power. The centre of power of the Dream. The Dreamfold. Where the influence of The Dream is the strongest. This turns out to be part of Jason's plan. He has taken (he hopes) adequate precautions. He is forced into the water. 

Jason connects to the spiral. He feels it retaliate, trying to take over his mind, and he redirects it into the spike. He feels intense pain as the spiral attacks the spike. Jason completes the connection.

He sees The Dream. Visions of the entire world all at once. The past. The Present. The Future. Answers to things beyond his understanding. His mind cannot process it, so slowly he guides it. 

Jason stretches the vision. Tuning to a pulsing power. A different well of power. Searching for an answer to a question. The Shard. The more powerful thing he needed to complete the resurrection. He traces it through Sunktopeth. Into Ashkara, the capital of the Chish Empire. Into the Thul itself. He sees this power in the past. Hechilspet wielding it in his ascension. 

Janvar, at the same time, guides it elsewhere. Trying to see Nebelum's plans. Seeing Leth. Connecting to it through the Dreamfold. It seems blurred. Fragile. He glimpses Theriad, who seems to him like the tiniest of ants. He can sense someone is doing something to the plane. Some work is on the verge of being done. He reflexively tries to pull on the work with The Dream. To pull it closer to see it better, but the motion causes some sort of shattering, setting something in motion. 

Jason follows the Shard, tracing its pulses, away from the Ashkara Thul. 

And directly to Lilith.

She had told him about it in the first place. He had told her he was looking for it and she had denied knowing where it was. 

She looks directly at him in the vision. He feels her mind turn against the scrying. Lingering. With a growing sense of wrongness, he can feel her pushing against it, and the vision suddenly finds itself yanked away, churning, darkened. The Dream seems repelled by some sudden powerful force exerted by Lilith.

This force echoes throughout the dream, causing aftershocks and echoes, and moments later, something else stirs in The Dream. Someone else. Jason warns Janvar as Janvar's vision begins falling apart.

They feel another being, more powerful than them, exerting a force on The Dream, questioning who else is there. Wrapping itself around them. Overpowering the remnants of their visions. They get a sense of an overwhelming presence, an unstoppable force, just as they are expelled from the Dreamfold. 

Janvar exits the pool. Seeing him still not dominated by The Dream, the Bharamites rush him. Janvar has already planned for this. He draws a bottle with Nullmetal powder and uncorks it and threatens to drop it into the pool, destroying The Dream. His other hand holds a strange glowing bronze disk.

The Bharamites seem scared of him, but a moment later he feels the presence again. Filling the cave, speaking. Its power overwhelming and powerful. The Bharamites seem transfixed as its voice echoes across the cave. The voice identifies itself as belonging to Bechel, the Kharrish sorceress. She comforts the Bharamites and tells them not to be afraid, and laments not being able to make a physical appearance, as she is far away on unspecified business. She turns her attention to Janvar, and commends him and Jason inside of him for their tenacity. She calls his appearance unexpected, but that it may solve a few problems for her. She claims to have a proposition for the two of them. 

Somewhere far away, Theriad suddenly appears, half-dead, in the middle of Renk and Jolvin's living room, scaring Vardarul. 

A silvery magic hand knocks on Duthrim and Lorim's home.
