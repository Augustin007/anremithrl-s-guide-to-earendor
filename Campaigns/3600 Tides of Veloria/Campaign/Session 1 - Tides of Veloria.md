Jorin and Aranyaka navigate the flooded halls of forgotten knowledge. 
They encounter strange frog people. 
They try various methods to get across.
Their stuff gets stolen.
They confront the frog people and trade knowledge to get their stuff back and get into the vault, brute forcing it rather than solving the riddle.
