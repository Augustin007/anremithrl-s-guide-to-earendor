#### Summary
Jorin Neuman, Aranyaka, and Orion deal with the strange going-ons in Veloria.
Jorin and Aranyaka are sent to find the Codex of Ebb and Flow in the flooded halls of forgotten knowledge. After some brief encounters with thieving frog-people, they obtain it, along with some other treasures. They deliver it and find the contact's behaviour strange and spy on him, but can't figure anything out. Aranyaka meets Orion by while trying to pawn off some of the other items they found. Jorin copies the book from memory.
