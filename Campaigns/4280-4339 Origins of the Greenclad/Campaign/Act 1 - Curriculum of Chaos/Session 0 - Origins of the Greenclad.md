Session 0

This session we established our characters, and as part of it, I asked them how move-in went. Here is a compilation of notes:

Daedroy and Stoic are suite-mates studying medicine. Lawful-chaotic duality.
Narnor is a noble in the highborn suite, playing the game of politics and popularity. Studying theoretical evocation.
Richard, also studying theoretical evocation. Poor. From small village. Commoner. Here on scholarship. Naturally talented at magic. Genius. Scholarship suite.
Miyatol, also from small village. Studying history. Trained in combat by his guard father. Partial scholarship plus loans has put him in a triple.

Daedroy is the first to move in. Unpacks meticulously. Orderly. He steps inside his assigned suite—two bedrooms, a shared study space, and a small adjoining washroom.

Excerpt from player's notes of that day:
> The bed is firm and evenly made—acceptable.
> The desk is clear, polished, functional—excellent.
> The bookshelves are ample but unorganized—fixable.

He spends the first few days studying as he waits for classes to begin and his suite-mates to arrive.

Narnor arrives at the highborn suite. Her servants carried her luggage—polished trunks embossed with the sigil of Azerim in Golin, their contents worth more than some entire student scholarships.
Nobles at the college. She thrives on the game of popularity and politics. She quickly meets and establishes cammaraderie with the people who _matter_, deflects any insults with wit and precision, quickly establishing herself as a leader, inviting others and organising, she sees Elira Valthorne clashing for her position and cleanly puts her in her place. _Second_. Narnor is going to be at the top. She gets Rhia to become her devoted follower.

Excerpt from player's notes of that day:
> Elira Valthorne – poised, calculating, politically dangerous.
> Markos Durn – charismatic, but plays second-fiddle too easily.
> Rhia Valderon – beautiful, influential, but not nearly as intelligent.
> Vivienne Halloway – new to Strixhaven’s elite. This one has potential, but she doesn’t know the game yet.

She eventually retreats to her personal suite with her servants, and looks down at others bellow, feeling isolated and lonely, unlike the rush she was feeling moments before. She wonders what it's like to be a commoner like those bellow.

Richard is a born genius. Perfect recall, deeply advanced, and a bit arrogant at the end of the day, he thinks he'll make it because he's _smarter_ than everyone. He has no doubts, not even one. He's not intimidated. He's amazed and dazzled by the wealth, but he only cares about intelligence. His scholarship grants him a single. It's more wealth than he's ever had. The entirety of his belongings fit in a small satchel. He only unpacks what he needs. Books and quills and paper. He doesn't unpack his clothes or keepsakes. He's here to show he's the best. He hardly takes in the expensive room he's in. Gets rid of all distractions. He doesn't doubt he'll belong. He's here to win. He doesn't rest or reflect, he studies. Not out of responsibility but out of passion. He's smarter than all of them, in his mind, that's all that matters.


---

Miyatol is in awe. His family had barely managed to get him into college, between loans and small scholarships. He'll be paying it off for years. If he failed... he didn't want to think about that. He's apprehensive. One of his roommates, a human named Eldan, has already moved in. Eldan tries to make conversation with Miyatol, but Eldan comes from some amount of academic background and Miyatol, intimidated, doesn't really engage with him. He unpacks methodically. Eventually another suitemate, another human, Aric, arrives. Eldan and Aric talk to each other and Miyatol feels very out of place, and wonders if he's come to the right decision in going here.

---

Stoic's move-in date is as late as it can get. He arrives two hours later than that, much to Daedroy's consternation. His bags—half-unzipped, filled with loose books and alchemy vials clinking together dangerously—was slung over one shoulder. He unpacks chaotically. Clothes? Thrown into drawers, no folding necessary. Books? Dropped in a pile on the desk. Alchemy vials? Scattered haphazardly on the shelf. He has more things than he likely ought to, and it takes him several trips. Daedroy takes an initial disliking to him. Stoic doesn't notice, and talks friendly to Daedroy. Daedroy decides to get over his dislikes, and decides to be friendly to Stoic.
