Richard Iwaelfhem and Stoic Vanem, meet each other on their first day of classes at Strixhaven. They quickly become good friends as they wait for the professor. Richard notices Narnor and some of her friends sitting across the lecture hall, also in the front row.

Professor Silaris Meradune, a reclusive genius, walks in and immediately begins writing complex formulae on the board. No introductions. No syllabus.

Richard participates a lot in class, competing against Narnor on who can correct the teacher more. He sees her as snobbish and elite. She sees him as arrogant and overconfident.

Miyatol, meanwhile, is attending a history class under Dr. Saline Averhill. His class was overwhelming—pages upon pages of required readings, theoretical discussions about the role of written versus oral histories in magical societies.

After class, Richard introduces Miyatol to Stoic. Miyatol's just come from his own class, where he felt out of his depth. Stoic and Richard encourage Miyatol. At Stoic's invitation, they go to Stoic's suite. The difference in both halves of the room is quite clear, organised and chaotic. Daedroy is annoyed at unnanounced visitors, but quickly befriends the responsible Miyatol, and by extention Richard, who he quickly realises is also serious and competitive.

Narnor and a section of her group eat together. Elira, seeing her opportunity against Narnor speaks well of Richard. Markos takes Narnor's side, flirting with her. Narnor does her best to maintain control, but she's tired, distracted, and her pride is wounded by competing with Richard. She eventually retreats to her room and decides to sleep to get away from all her thoughts.

Daedroy and Stoic have a class together. So the four agree to meet later. Stoic doesn't even bring his materials, relying on memory and cleverness to hope to get through the class, not expecting much better than a passing grade.

Meanwhile Richard admits he only joined Dueling club because he saw Miyatol wanted to go, and has never fought before in any capacity. Miyatol begins teaching Richard the basics of fighting so that he's prepared for the club later in the day.

When they reunite, the four of them decide to explore the campus a bit. 

The Emerald Walk, where enchanted streetlights float above pathways.
The Silver Fountain, rumored to reflect one’s fate if you stare into it.
The Grand Archives, where books organize themselves and whisper forgotten secrets.

Narnor is awoken by one of her servants. She prepares to go to the club meetings.

Club meetings.

Early duel training and whatnot. No actual duels yet. Someone mocks Miyatol's "commoner dueling style".  Ganya takes an interest in Miyatol, telling him to “Prove them wrong.” Richard struggles with something for one of the first times in his life, and Miyatol thinks this means he isn't enjoying it, but Richard actually really enjoyed the struggle.

Daedroy and Stoic attend the Medical Fraternity meeting, where they meet Professor Carim Vale, and meet again with Serik. Daedroy rapidly proves himself competent and Serik offers him a chance to shadow him in healing practicals. Stoic ditches the medical fraternity meeting along with fellow student Tarkis Vorr after being scolded by the professor, to Daedroy's severe embarasment. 

The two pull some pranks and cause some chaos.

Richard tries to sneak into the evocation meeting. Narnor catches him and exposes him. Richard is laughed at, humiliated, and taken out. Leris announces an upcoming Evocation Trial, for members only. This only makes the Narnor-Richard rivalry a bigger part of the highborn gossip.

Richard waits until Narnor leaves the meeting and confronts her angrily.

Miyatol skips a history lecture, wandering the campus alone. Sees Richard and Narnor arguing again and wonders why Richard cares so much. He doesn't feel like he belongs here at all.

Richard beats Narnor in wit before marching off angrily. Elira praises him for beating Narnor, making Narnor hate Richard more.
