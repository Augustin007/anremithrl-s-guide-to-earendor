Session XXII: Meeting the Werebear
- The group that stays behind plant explosives in the fountain and evade guards, and trigger it remotely after leaving.
- The group that goes ahead meets Dirk, a Goliath who lives far outside of town. He gives them soup, and seems awfully kind. But has a sad nature to him. They thank him and go on their way.
- The groups meet at Cair Dineval.
