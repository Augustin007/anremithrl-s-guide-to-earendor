Session XXVIII:  Kalquend Conundrum
- At Termaline, the party agrees to meet at a bar. They are low on funds and equipment. 
- William uses his guild membership and checks that route. PINE-APL begins work on his new companion as the other one died in the battle for Dineval.
- Greg sells garlic.
- William finds a bounty of 1000 Platinum for Kalquend for the murder of a lord.
- Greg and Colossus argue against killing Kalquend, especially without more information. PINE-APL doesn't comment. The other three are all for it. Colossus refuses to help, while Greg wants to begin returning home, but Nugget convinces him to stay. And guilt-trips him into helping.
- They enter Kalquend's garden. After talking with him for a bit, they make a plan to jump him. He seems jumpy. 
- He reads their minds when they make the plan. Right before they ambush him, he stops them. He petrifies Lady Black and magically holds Greg. Pushing people aside with gravity.
