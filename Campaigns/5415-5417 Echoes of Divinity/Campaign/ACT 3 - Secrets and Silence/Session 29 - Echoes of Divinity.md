Session XXIX:  Battle for Balance
- A long fight with Kalquend. He seems to dodge all their attacks, and constantly tries to stop them. Kalquend summons elementals and awakens statues as he gets more and more desperate. Though they keep on freeing each other, he continues to try to incapacitate and capture, not to kill. Colossus rushes in to help Greg get away and heal Nugget, but refuses to help. 
- The battle gets fiercer and Kalquend's attempts to get away become more desperate. Colossus is trying to stop the fight. By an accident, Kalquend injures Colossus and Greg. Greg dies and Kalquend barely manages to heal Colossus, opening himself up for an attack by PINE-APL, who kills him.
