Session XXX: Departure and Determination
- Nugget prevents Kalquend's soul from departing.
- Kalquend, as a ghost, sets off the alarm of his tower. Final failsafes go off. A giant statue attacks them, trying to free Kalquend's ghost, but they stop the statue and Nugget takes the Flail of Terror it used.
- They force Kalquend to guide them through his tower without setting off traps, and help take anything of value. It takes a lot of equivocation and malicious compliance from the ghost before they can get what they want. They notice Colossus is gone.
- Colossus is holding a small funeral for Greg. He takes what money he has and leaves a message for the group as he leaves.
- The main party discovers the truth about Kalquend. Kalquend discovered a child slave ring run by lords of Termaline, who attempted to have him killed. In the confusion, he killed one of the lords. His attempts to denounce the lords have been branded as slander. They set the bounty to silence him. Children are captured from lonelywood.
- The party decides to do nothing about it.
- Nugget's oath starts to tear him apart, and they collect the bounty and try to find Colossus.
