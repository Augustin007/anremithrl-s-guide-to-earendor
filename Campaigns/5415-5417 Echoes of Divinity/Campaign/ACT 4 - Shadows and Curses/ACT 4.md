- He sees the party looking for him when he reaches Oracus, and begins fleeing west. The party catches up to him and stops him. They remind him of their oath to Idros.
Session XXXII: Masks and Magic
- They return to Oracus. They meet a ship engineer named Scotty who helps them with the ship. 
- Since they didn't know if there was still a bounty, Nugget magically conceals himself while Colossus ends up going alone into a shop called Masks and More on Magic Street, Neros. 
- The employees who talk to him seem to act strangely, and the prices are expensive. In the end he buys a wax mask with no eyeholes or mouthholes.
Nugget went to a spellcasting shop to buy spells for his new flying boat, while William went to buy a bottle of alcohol to christen the boat.

PINE-APL spotted a man selling repair robots and thought it would be beneficial to have one for himself. He didn't realize the irony of a robot owning another robot. Meanwhile, Jess slipped away to find a secret room on the boat where she could conduct alchemy experiments. She was working on a new formula when she accidentally created a toxic substance that filled the room with a cloud of green gas. She stumbled out of the room, coughing and gasping for air.

- Colossus talks with Klaethor and Klaethor lends him use of his library. The two develop a minor friendship.
As the party continues to search through the hold, Jess stumbles upon the Cli lyre, an ancient magical lyre. Her old love for music and art is rekindled, and she disappears into her cabin to play and experiment with the instrument's abilities.
Meanwhile, PINE-APL repairs the pirate ship, making it airworthy once again. Nugget then gives the prisoners a choice - they can work for the party, crew the ship, and earn money, or leave for freedom. Surprisingly, 20 of the freed slaves choose to stay and work for the party.

- The party takes turns drawing cards, while Colossus broods belowdecks about Kalquend. He decides to give the party a chance since they are supporting him now.
- They trick Colossus into drawing a card. He gains three wishes. Angered, he chooses not to use them.

- The party heads into Thilcerth and tries to figure out how to get Nugget back.
- Colossus reaches the Halls of Memory. He touches the outer curtain and is immediately immersed in the past. He sees his past self urging the mob, he sees people being trampled. He sees the massacre he helped create.
- He confronts his past self. Every argument he makes, his past self turns aside, just as he knew he would. He seperates himself from his past self, vowing to never be like that again, filled with hatred. His memory clears and he sees again. There is now a door in the wall, and he enters.
Session XL: Forgeries and Frauds
- Colossus speaks with a man who identifies himself as Eolande, a servant of the Raven Queen, as he guides Colossus through the halls.
- The party finds a drunkard and come up with a plan to rename him to "a soul of equal or greater value".

Session XLII: Curses and Consequences
- Azmodeus appears in the Fortress, using the link from the mask. He confers alone with Colossus. He agrees to free Nugget if Colossus agrees to not undo the curse left on him by his mask, explaining how he orchestrated Colossus getting the mask. Colossus agrees if Asmodeus changes the curse so that it undoes itself the moment Colossus wants to, and to free Nugget from his service. Asmodeus agrees to change the curse to include that clause, but that Nugget must render one last service to Asmodeus.
- The curse is changed, Colossus cannot want to remove it, or want to want to remove it, or want to want to want to... et al.
- Asmodeus uses careful phrasing to trick the party into thinking he is giving them Azmodeus of his own free will, and consumes the man in fire as an offering.
