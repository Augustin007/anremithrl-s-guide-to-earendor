Session XXXI: Compromise and Consequences
- As Nugget is tortured and slowly dying from the oath, the party negotiates the sale of a flying ship. They sail it through the air using the oath to track Colossus.
- Colossus on his fare falls asleep and free of the shadow of Azmodeus, speaks to the Raven Queen for the first time. He swears a variant of the hippocratic oath, and vows to search for her.
- He sees the party looking for him when he reaches Oracus, and begins fleeing west. The party catches up to him and stops him. They remind him of their oath to Idros.
