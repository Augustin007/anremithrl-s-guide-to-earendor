Session XXXII: Masks and Magic
- They return to Oracus. They meet a ship engineer named Scotty who helps them with the ship. 
- Since they didn't know if there was still a bounty, Nugget magically conceals himself while Colossus ends up going alone into a shop called Masks and More on Magic Street, Neros. 
- The employees who talk to him seem to act strangely, and the prices are expensive. In the end he buys a wax mask with no eyeholes or mouthholes.
Nugget went to a spellcasting shop to buy spells for his new flying boat, while William went to buy a bottle of alcohol to christen the boat.

PINE-APL spotted a man selling repair robots and thought it would be beneficial to have one for himself. He didn't realize the irony of a robot owning another robot. Meanwhile, Jess slipped away to find a secret room on the boat where she could conduct alchemy experiments. She was working on a new formula when she accidentally created a toxic substance that filled the room with a cloud of green gas. She stumbled out of the room, coughing and gasping for air.

- Colossus stumbles through the stores. Through the mask he sees the bonfires and gets too close.
- The mask fuses to his face.
- Jessica is nearly caught by authorities. The group prepares to flee.
