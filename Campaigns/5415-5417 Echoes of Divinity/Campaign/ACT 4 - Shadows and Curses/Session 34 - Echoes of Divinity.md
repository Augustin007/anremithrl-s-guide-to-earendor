Session XXXIV: Surrender and Secrets
- Colossus asks William for help and by the bounty hunter guild manages to get himself taken to Klaethor. William collects the bounty on Colossus. Colossus orders Nugget to stay behind, nullifying the oath. The rendezvous point is the Deathwood.
- Colossus is stripped, the wax is taken off his face. He finds himself able to lie incredibly convincingly even in truth fields.
- Klaethor meets and frees Colossus, after a brief questioning, based on the correspondence delivered by Padfoot.
