Session XXXV: Pirates and Peril
- The party heads north to the Rendezvous point and are attacked by pirates. 
- They free the pirates' slaves and stage a rebellion after boarding with magic. 
- They're almost caught, but William manages to threaten the captain, and the captain as a last ditch effort tries to use the deck of many things, and it destroys him. 
- Colossus talks with Klaethor and Klaethor lends him use of his library. The two develop a minor friendship.
As the party continues to search through the hold, Jess stumbles upon the Cli lyre, an ancient magical lyre. Her old love for music and art is rekindled, and she disappears into her cabin to play and experiment with the instrument's abilities.
Meanwhile, PINE-APL repairs the pirate ship, making it airworthy once again. Nugget then gives the prisoners a choice - they can work for the party, crew the ship, and earn money, or leave for freedom. Surprisingly, 20 of the freed slaves choose to stay and work for the party.
