Session XL: Forgeries and Frauds
- Colossus speaks with a man who identifies himself as Eolande, a servant of the Raven Queen, as he guides Colossus through the halls.
- The party finds a drunkard and come up with a plan to rename him to "a soul of equal or greater value". They're unable to get real documents processed, and thus settle for having William make forgeries while Lady Black and PINE-APL clean him up and try to coach him on what to say to make the deception work.
