Session XLIII - Luring Loquail
- Loqail meets the party. They verbally spar with him, and he manages to secure the magical permission to use them as passage back to his homeland after tricking them with illusionary coins. Once he obtained this, just as the party realised the coins were an illusion, he dissolved into mist.
- Colossus returns. 
- Nugget is traumatised and doesn't talk much. The day above was a thousand years in hell for him. He swears an oath of terrible vengeance.
