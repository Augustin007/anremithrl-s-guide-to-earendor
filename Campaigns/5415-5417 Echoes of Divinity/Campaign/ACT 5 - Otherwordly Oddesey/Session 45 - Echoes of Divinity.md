Session XLV - Chasing Illusions
- To buy time, Seelie leaves illusions behind. Lady Black is chased by imaginary wolves. William Treaty talks to squirrels who beg for his help.
- Colossus sees an illusionary bowl of milk in the middle of the woods and drinks it.
- Nugget and PINE-APL are unnafected. They watch the party start to seperate, along with the ship's crew, and try to free each of their illusions.
- Colossus dispels the illusion when he realises, then sees mushrooms (assasin's candy) and decides to eat them and is quickly in critical condition.
- William manages to salvage the mushrooms and plans to use them.
- Nugget manages to save Colossus.
- Lady Black finds her way through the forest, seperated from the group, and sees elves dancing and drinking. She joins in, and quickly finds she cannot physically stop dancing or laughing and drinking. 
- They played faster and faster, and Lady Black eventually passes out of exhaustion.
- They get attacked by some form of illusion monster as they try to regroup the people.
- From 12, five of the crewmates are not found when they regroup at the ship.
- Lady Black is woken and questioned by an elf. After some harsh words, she is exiled from their court and rejoins the party.
