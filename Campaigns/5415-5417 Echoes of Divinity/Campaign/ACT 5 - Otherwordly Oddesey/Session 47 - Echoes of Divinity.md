Session XLVII - Lavore's Laughs and Traveler's Tricks
- Lost in the city, unable to speak the language, they are approached by a man who names himself Eleutheros. He is an ascending arch-fey elf quasi-deity. 
- He gives them a guidebook that changes based on their expectation and shows different things to each person.
- They navigate the city with difficulty. 
- He tells them that to get back, they must speak with the unforgiving lady and confront Seelie.
- The Traveller gives Lady Black his Sigil and a set of bracelets for her to use to teleport her friends around.
- In the end, through a long and convoluted route, they make it to the other side of the city. (Two people, William and Colossus, just went straight across, ignoring the guidebook, and got there way earlier, drinking illusion-summoned drinks, waiting for the others)
- PINE-APL finishes development of his brand-new weapon.
