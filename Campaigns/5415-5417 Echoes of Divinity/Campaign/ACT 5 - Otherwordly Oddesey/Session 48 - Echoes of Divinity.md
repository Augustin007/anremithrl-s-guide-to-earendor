Session XLVIII - Facing the Unforgiving Lady
- The party speaks with the Unforgiving Lady. Loquail is at her side. She seems unstable. She ends up leaving. The moment Loquail steps out of her protection, William and PINE-APL attack and kill him with PINE-APL's new weapon, the distancer (gun) and bowshot.
