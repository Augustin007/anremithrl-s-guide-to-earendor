[[Act 5]]
Session IL: The stuff at Westhaven and the bank and snow
- Upon Seelie's death, the party is dispelled from the Feywild. 
- They find themselves back at Westhaven. Seeing the ruins, they track looting to the big bank vault, once the lair of the dragon that fathered the dragonborn here, and sumarise that someone has taken the bank as an outpost and looted most the city. They try to break into the vault, quickly, large armoured machine constructs attack and subdue them. They are brought into the vault.
- William pockets a strange looking item. A black plate of sorts.
Session L: Meeting Talberius
- Here they meet Tal'berius, the Architect Arcane who chose to stay. He seems to change his mind constantly, and never sleeps. He seems incredibly tired and moody. He's rude to PINE-APL but insanely wealthy, and has scrapped most items in the town for their parts for his inventions. Everything in his laboratory has also been moved to the vault.
- They talk with him and agree to go further north to recover one of his goods that he claims was stolen by a man known as Faledric.
Session LI: Falledric, Ordus Texerum, Knife, and Orb of Anhiliation (Jaquiline Finch).

Session LIII: Running around Bremen again, alchemist, getting turned into a plant. Starting a race war. And the underdark.

- They use the bracelets to teleport together. 

Session LIV: Meeting Me, talking to Me. Teresa/Clara/Tyler etc. Ashdilir.
- They enter the tunnel and pass the traps. In the inside they find a library, which spans as far as they can see in all directions. Filled with books and books that appear to be diaries, different names and lives, all girls. In the library they meet a young-looking girl. She tries to remember her name, but in the end just calls herself "me". She lives in this library. When they ask her what the deal is with the library, she again answers "me."
- Around her neck she has a necklace with a dark, opaque, rough orangeish shattery glass gem.
Session LV: The fight
- Tal'berius shows up and confronts her. She's incredibly old, but her mortal mind was never meant to comprehend all of this. After a brief fight, the party sides against Tal'berius. They barely manage to handle one of his Taxblades as Tal'berius flees. They chase after him. Nugget meets with me and she gives him the necklace and guides him to a hallway.
Session LVI: The doors
- They teleport back together and follow with Nugget down the hallway. They find doors and doors and doors. Each door leads somewhere else. As the doors open and close, and time passes, they quickly wind up in different places.
