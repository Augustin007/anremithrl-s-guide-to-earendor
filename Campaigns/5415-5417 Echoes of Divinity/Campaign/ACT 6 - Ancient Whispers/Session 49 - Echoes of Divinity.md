Session IL: The stuff at Westhaven and the bank and snow
- Upon Seelie's death, the party is dispelled from the Feywild. 
- They find themselves back at Westhaven. Seeing the ruins, they track looting to the big bank vault, once the lair of the dragon that fathered the dragonborn here, and sumarise that someone has taken the bank as an outpost and looted most the city. They try to break into the vault, quickly, large armoured machine constructs attack and subdue them. They are brought into the vault.
- William pockets a strange looking item. A black plate of sorts.
