Session LIII: Running around Bremen again, alchemist, getting turned into a plant. Starting a race war. And the underdark.
- The party reaches Bremen. Stopping for supplies and to fix the ship, Lady Black sees the fountain they blew up. The gravestones of a small family lie there. She is horrified. 
- A strung up Goliath, (Dirk) hangs not far, he is blamed for the attack.
- Goliath-Dwarven tensions are at an all time high.
- Nugget takes advantage of this and kills a group of dwarves and writes in blood "For Dirk." Hopes to start race war.
- PINE-APL stays on the ship for a quick getaway.
- William Treaty follows Tal.
- The shipmates buy supplies.
- Colossus meets an alchemist and agrees to test potions for pay. He nearly dies several time, and turns into a greasy plant-person with pink soap bubbles coming out of his mouth.
- William follows Tal into the underdark.
- William is identified as "Her chosen one," and granted admiration by a group in the underdark. He seems to understand the language. The magical dagger in his hands seems to grow colder and to have a hold on him.
- He tracks Tal to a tunnel and calls everyone else to help.
- They use the bracelets to teleport together.
