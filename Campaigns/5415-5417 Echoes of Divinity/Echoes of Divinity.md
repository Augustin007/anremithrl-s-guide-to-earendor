#### Summary
A ragtag group of unlikely companions—King Colossus Methunroa, the exiled dragonborn prince Nil’ge’tar "Nugget" Remshi, the enigmatic construct PINE-APL, the ex-military bounty hunter William Treaty, and the cunning rogue and bard Lady Jessica Black—are drawn together by fate and divine manipulation. Bound by oaths, vengeance, and ambition, they traverse a world on the brink of destruction, caught in the machinations of gods, betrayers, and primordial forces. As their paths intertwine, they shape the fate of Eärendor, for better or worse. Some will embrace their divine callings, while others will be consumed by them.
After a series of adventures, an unlikely group is formed, bound by different motivations and tied to different divine forces, the party of five travels towards the tree of names.
Colossus Methunroa, an eccentric and arrogant gnome wizard, awakens from stone. Accidentally sparking a massacre in his attempt to reclaim the other stone gnomes. He meets Nil’ge’tar "Nugget" Remshi, the exiled black dragonborn prince, a man of wrath and ambition, forced into a pact with Asmodeus to survive. After a coup, they are forced to flee along with PINE-APL, an escaped sentient construct. Haunted by visions of the Raven Queen, Colssus slowly turns from his past hatred into a moral anchor for the party. Along with ex-military bounty hunter William Treaty, and criminal and artist Lady Black, they are sent on a mission to discover the truth of Auril's summoning.
They destroy fountains, fight bounty hunters, buy flying ships, and struggle with their different moralities the entire time. Colossus's strong morals, Nil'ge'tar's black hatred. PINE-APL's analytical mind clashing with the chaotic world of flesh and faith. William Treaty, who sees gods and kings alike as obstacles to be exploited. And Lady Jessica Black, a rogue raised by crime and deception, with her moral indifference.
They each make bargains and tie themselves to different gods until they arrive at the Tree of Names, where after a climatic final battle, they delay the destruction of the tree of names, but accidentally free Tartarus.
