[[Session 1 - Conspiracy of Darkness |<-prev]]
They try to continue towards Ashkara Thul, against Dren's wishes. Vorlin and Saria talk, getting along quite well, making Kaelith somewhat jealous. Xalvor and Dren talk about Edrin Vel.

In the distance, they see the figure. They chase again, but it vanishes. They track the figure and find the killed by a trap. 

Xalvor is shaken. Dren states that they should turn back. The parameters of the mission were purely scouting, and they have the location of the Ashkara. 

Saria pokes at and flirts with Kaelith, the two are interested enough to want to continue investigating, against the parameters of the mission. They egg on Xalvor. Dren finally gives in.

The party suggests various different ideas, none of which reaches agreement.

Vorlin suggests an inflitration mission, inspired by the robes from the dead cultist. Dren states that so far, this is the best idea, but reiterates that they should turn back. Vorlin offers that Dren can turn back on his own, but the other four will continue. Xalvor seems torn.

They debate the idea of an inflitration until they finally decide to rest.

The next day, they make it to a ridge over which they can see the excavation site of Ashkara Thul. The cult is much larger scale than they had imagined, and are slowly uncovering the pyramid and lands around it.
