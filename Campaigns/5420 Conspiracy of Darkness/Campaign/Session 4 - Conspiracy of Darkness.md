[[Session 3 - Conspiracy of Darkness |<-prev]]
The party hears screams echoing through the corridors. They stay in their rooms.

The next day, Kaelith is missing. His bed is covered in blood and ichor.

Saria is devastated.

The party attempt to search for him, but his trail leads into the sarcophagus. They fear the worst.

The remaining four work on the dig site under the cult, looking for the last ritual. Realising that the cult is missing a crucial piece of information from the riddle on the markerstone, Xalvor figures out the actual location of the last ritual.

Xalvor, Saria, and Dren decide to sneak away and find it and destroy it. Vorlin remains behind, not trusting Xalvor to not blow their cover, and blaming him for Kaelith's disappearance. 

As they leave, Vorlin goes to the cult and gives them away in exchange for a bribe, claiming Xalvor was the only true heretic to the cause, and the others were tricked by him.

The three find the enterance to a small temple in which the ritual resides. They enter and pass the traps with some difficulty. Inside, they find a sphinx, which challenges them with a riddle. When they fail it, the sphinx attacks them, but they hold her off until they figure out the riddle, after which she stops. Xalvor is wounded in this confrontation.

They reach the last ritual and are about to destroy it when the cultists arrive. Vorlin kills Xalvor and takes the ritual. Saria attempts to collapse the temple with a powerful spell. Vorlin counterspells and the cultists subdue her. 

Dren lies and says he has nothing to do with this, and was tricked.
