[[Hechilspet]]†

Five sorcerers infiltrate the Coven of Hechilspet to attempt to stop the Exiled God's return. They fail and all die. The Exiled God, Hechilspet, escapes his prison.
The Council of Sol'karis hears rumours of a new attempt to free Hechilspet. Scrambling for time, they send messages to various other organisations. They send five mages to attempt to infiltrate and spy on these rumours in the meantime. Xalvor, Saria, Dren, Kaeleth, and Vorlin. The five travel to the underground ruins of Ashkara Thul, Hechilspet's pyramid over which he ascended, and under which he was captured.
Finding a large coven there, the five attempt to infiltrate, pretending to be new initiates. They quickly find the coven is a lot larger and more powerful than they could have guessed, seeing ancient runes and the coven leader wielding great power. 
The coven captures members of the Councli of Sol'karis, and hands one of them over to Xalvor and Saria to execute. Xalvor hesitates and blanches, while Saria has no problem, driving a wedge between them. Dren, Vorlin, and Kaeleth try to get closer to the pyramid. Kaeleth touches the sarcophogus and has a vision of Hechilspet escaping.
Xalvor's hesitation puts them all under suspicion, and Vorlin sides with Saria against him, while Dren defends Xalvor. Kaeleth talks about his own shadowed past, studying forbidden texts, and wonders whether Xalvor might be the best of them, for not being tempted by power.
In the night, Kaeleth sees a vision of Hechilspet speaking to him.
That night, Kaelith disappears, his bed covered in black ichor. His screams echo through the corridors, but no one finds him. They are being watched.
The cultists speak to Vorlin, and bribe him.
The group tracks down the last ritual.
The group attempts to sabotage the ritual early, but Vorlin betrays them and brings the cultists to them. In the confrontation, he claims Xalvor was the only infiltrant and kills Xalvor. Saria is enraged and  tries to bring down the temple on everyone with a powerful fire spell, but Vorlin counterspells. They are captured. Dren lies and says he has nothing to do with it, and defends Vorlin's actions to Saria in whispers. 
Dren and Vorlin talk. Vorlin, further up in the cult now, reveals that he has discovered they have a patron, an unknown figure who has provided them with resources, magic, and knowledge lost to time. Dren attempts to discover who it is.
Saria manages to use a poison she smuggled to poison her own cup, and demands to speak to Vorlin. She drinks from it and has him drink as well, and they both die.
Dren watches as the cultists commit the final ritual. He attempts to sabotage it at the last moment, but is stopped by Kaeleth, who emerges from the shadows. Kaeleth is magically charmed and has been seduced by the promises of power from Hechilspet, and fights Dren. Dren manages to undo Hechilspet's deception on Kaeleth and dispell the charms, and they turn on the cultists a moment to late. Hechilspet is returned. They fight him and he easily kills them both.
