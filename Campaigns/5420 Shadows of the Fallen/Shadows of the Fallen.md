[[Fendril]] (a Human Scout from Golin), [[Eglath]] (a Goliath Cavalryman from Solenthir), and [[Harnvol]] (a Dwarven Artificer from Othron Ibrith.

After the massacre at chokepoint Zeta, they had banded together, days later, the necromancer [[Korvos]] found them and dragged them to his lair. 

[[Ashdilkir]] visits Korvos asking about progress on his favor to her. The three prisoners speak to Ashdilkir, trying to beg for her help, but she talks to Korvos about them, and they get the sense she is even crueler than Korvos.

As Korvos and Ashdilkir leave, her voice comes into their heads. "Run," and their chains snap.

They run through the halls.  They find experiment chambers with surgical tools and such. At the end of a hallway, they see a flesh golem, stitched out of bodies of their comrades. They are seen by it, and barely manage to kill it before it raises the alarm.

They eventually find a hidden passage, leading to a bunch of tombs. Illusions of their fallen comrades appear. They think there is an exit from light coming down a passageway. They dash towards it and it becomes a hole and triggers an alarm. It was a decoy. All the undead wake up and attack them.

They fight and get away and hide. They continue fighting undead as they try to navigate the lair. 

They find a map that guides them to the entrance. They slowly make their way there. They solve the riddle to disarm the magical seal and open it, hoping to see the outside.

Instead, they see darkness. Korvos had set this up. Their suffering was his amusement. Korvos attacks them. He kills them slowly and painfully as they fight him. Breaking them apart. Laughing the whole time.
