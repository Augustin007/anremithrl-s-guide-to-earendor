The campaign opens on General Galio Thunukaladri entering the chambers of King Aukun Kalagiano.

Because of Auril's continued expansion over the frozen north and into the south, supply lines to places like Solenthir have frozen up. The old pass, through the dragonborn countries, is useless since they no longer allow people to come through, and the dragons guard their borders and the prison of the betrayer gods jealously (Stuff from last campaign.)

Galio has been fighting Auril and her forces for years, staving them away from Solenthir, but without imports of food and wood, the people of Solenthir will freeze to death. Auril's eternal winter has long made it impossible for them to grow their own food.

Galio is told to abandon the fortress of Katholaga which he had originally been ordered to reinforce, and instead to go south and try to open up Aldarkeep pass, and to see if he could find some shipping company or provider willing to trade with the north.

He is also told to find out what happened at the Tree of Names and the Prison of the Betrayers three years ago, since no one really knows what happened even now, only that whatever happened was part of the late King Idros of Thundrak's plan to defeat Auril, and that the king of the Dragonborn countries, Draco-Remshi's son Nugget Remshi (Galio's player's old character) died at that battle.

King Aukun explains that they cannot hope to defend against Auril forever, so they must eventually strike an offensive. Since Gallio is already going south, he should act as an ambassador for Aukun, establishing the NAF - Northern Alliance of FoÃ©dus.

They codename Aldarkeep pass as Chokepoint Zeta, and Galio leaves.

Miles away, to the south, in the Kingdom of the Dallon Peninsula, the first summer snowfall occurs in Dallon. King Colossus sees the snow, and knows what is to come. He fought the goddess himself three years ago. With the guidance of the Raven Queen, he organises silos of food, and gathers his people in the city of Gnomeshelm, and prepares for what is to come. He sends envoys to nearby countries imploring them to take similar measures, and to stand in solidarity.

The Raven Queen whispers that he knows what he must do.

On another continent, in the city of Veloria, a magic steampunk New-York style metropolis, William speaks to his investors, who threaten to pull out after he insists on continuing ventures to the continent of Foedus, even though most ships that way are lost. He gets frustrated and several of his investors pull out. He sees it as an opportunity. No other shipping company is dealing with Foedus, much less the north of Foedus. He can gain a monopoly in that region. He doesn't doubt many countries are in need of imports and exports since Remshi shipping co. stopped shipping to the north, and the Dragonborn territories all locked themselves up. He decides to go to Foedus personally after a message from Noab, king of Golin. He takes his bow and boards his personal flying ship.

William lands his ship first in Gnomeshelm to visit Colossus, and Colossus and he draft a deal about trade and obtaining supplies through DragonsArrow Co. William then meets with the king Noab, and is introduced to Galio shortly thereafter.

This session was meant to be a reintroduction back into the world after a half-year break in real life, and a three-year break in game. I wanted to get a feel for the characters and how they'd changed, as well as the new character. I wanted to give separation in time so the non-returning characters' gaps in the party's dynamics could be filled.
