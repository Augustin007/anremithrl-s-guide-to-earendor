Krag finds out the ranger's name is Daroth. The two hear the host of elves running through the snow.

Krag and Daroth decide to start heading north to find Colossus.

Colossus searches for William as he starts to worry. 

Gallio meets up with two of his comandors, Branold of Golin and Carnoth of Othron Ibrith, who had been given orders to stage a coup is Gallio didn't follow orders. They explain that every other officer was _probably_ given the same order, so the ones that didn't come up to him might well be plotting against him. Branold wants to wait a bit to regroup. They discuss plans. Carnoth and Branold agree that the tree is the highest priority. Carnoth says that even above their countries, to which Gallio reluctantly agrees, though Branold says nothing.

9th of Hammer (21 of Badger)
He gives in to Tahlia, who needs him to look at a door. He uses her scroll to teleport him just past the edges of Westhaven (using Asmodeus to provide an exception to Auril's antiteleport, but not daring to mess with Tal'berius's). She shows him the door to a dungeon, but he refuses to open it for her, instead shooting an arrow of explosion at it. The door retaliates, and William is knocked out. The alarms start ringing. Tahlia draws blood from William and heals him. He tries to knock the vial out of his hand as she pushes him out of the area and teleports him to his 'home', as per the warning.

10th of Hammer
William wakes up in his old home in his home country of Swanward. He has not been here in twenty years, since his ten-year exile. 

He looks at pictures of his late wife, and some of his old friends, and some medals from his time in the war, and laughs at the fact that he'd _prefer_ that war. A war between mortals and mortals, over this, a war between mortals and gods. 

He goes to town to see if he can be healed. The town has changed much in twenty years, and in the end he has to ask for help. He finds old Freddy's area has closed up and finds out he died a few months ago. He finds also that his friend Edward has been promoted to captain of the guard. The town has gotten even richer over the years, but some areas remain unchanged.

He tries to remain inconspicuous, but when he enters the apothecary shop, he is greeted by Old Frederic Duncans grandson, William's childhood friend, Brian Duncan.
