1st of Hammer

(Time is nameless here, but hours in the mortal world _feel_ like years here. And yet nothing ever _happens_. The nine hells.)

Lady Black manages to convince the demons that surround her to take her to Archduke Dispater. She is terrified as his aura overpowers her. He shows her visions of the vast forces on his side. She finds herself agreeing that good will lose. That there is no hope. Once she escapes, though, she recollects her wits and talks to the people. 

She sings and dances and tells them the story of a little boy who becomes a tyrant, and how he leads his people in a war and into ruin for his own gain. How a traveler passed by who could have helped the people rise up against him, and how many did not follow because they were afraid, and there was no rebellion, and she says that it would have been better to have fallen in rebellion than to have lived in this state.

She gives a speech, and chanting "Kill the Boy", the crowd marches onto the Archduke's land. She runs and hides, as she hadn't meant this to happen, but the Archduke comes out and kills them all, a few escape, a few stand a little longer, but none for long and it begins to rain blood heavily. She nearly drowns in the blood, but escapes into the next level.
