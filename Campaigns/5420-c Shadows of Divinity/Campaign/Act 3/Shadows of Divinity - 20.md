11th Hammer
Faust's mind clears from the enchantment and he confronts Morgana. She easily overpowers him using the archfey's horse. Using the horse, Lucy commands her, she wakes the dragon, and enchants him to come to the city. 

Faust breaks his deal with her, and as she leaves she uses his reflected dissonant whispers to tell him that oathbreakers always pay a price. 


(Timeless, some point after 10th Hammer)
Colossus speaks with Araushnee and Tyr, and is offered a deal by Marethyu, to become his cleric and champion on the longest night, in exchange for being restored the power and freedom needed for him to help save the world. 

Colossus enquires things of Marethyu, and adds conditions to the deal. That his clericdom ends on the first light of the longest night. That Aurashnee be restored to her immortality and duties, and that everyone he wish to allow to leave Sigil, may. He asks the help of any of Marethyu's servants who are willing. Marethyu allows it, and Colossus returns to his ship, with Aurashnee and Tyr with him. They talk to Singollo and Tyr speaks to Hatreth. Falledric's powers slowly return.

17th Hammer
