Crag - poisoned, faced with Mind Flayer an hour and a half later.  
Colossus - met Feanor and the Iliithid in Sigil. He saw more of sigil. Met with Marethyu and saw a hint about Naema. Is being offered a proposition by Marethyu along with Araushnee and Tyr.  
William - Went to hospital. Recovered. Studied Vendetta Blades. Bought distancer, killed Tarrasque, and then worked on preparing the ships until morning. Thalia approaches him explaining her plan for the eye but he kills her. He identifies her gear.  
Gallio - tries to confront him when he faces Varook, but is stopped by blindness spells. At Oracus, he has final confrontation with Hechilspet's forces. He sweeps them aside into victory and kills Hechilspet, though Ardarul dies to a meteor swarm. Gallio earns the title godkiller, and uses Hechilspet's demiplane amulet for his army. He honours Ardarul and is granted Mithril armour by the dwarves. New dwarven general is Firngar, and Gallio Godkiller is named Zirvin, mighty-friend, by the Dwarves.
