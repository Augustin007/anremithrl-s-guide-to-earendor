I need my notes! I am missing so many characters!


Three years after _Echoes_. Colossus, William, Lady Black, Gallio, Krag, and Faust are caught in the whirlwind of politics, war, and magic as they attempt to stave off the end of the world.
After leading an alliance of armies in the defence of Aldarkeep Pass, General Gallio Thunukalathi is forced to retreat when his force is detailed and routed by the Dragon Ardor and by the knowledge of Bechel of Bharam. Auril's forces slip through into the south as Colossus and William fail to stop Azmodeus from taking over the international council of the continent of Foedus.
Krag is a member of Colossus's guard, an Earth Genasi, who contends with the growing trouble at Gnomes'helm as the city falls apart, but eventually chooses to go North.
Faust is an agent of Chaos bent on causing as much chaos as possible.
Hearing of Hechilspet's escape from Eleutheros's prison, Gallio and his armies go south to confront him. In an epic battle, Gallio kills Hechilspet, gaining the name Godkiller.
Colossus frees people from the city of doors after attempting to discover where the missing Raven Queen was. Krag accidentally frees an ancient god trapped in a deep pit while heading north to fight Auril. William uses his companies and wealth to become a major force, trying to take advantage of the chaos to buy out other companies which are in panic, and putting together a large mercenary military and trying to contact people as much as possible to create an alliance to defend the tree of names.
Lady Black travels the nine hells to gain allies, giving amnesty to any gods that choose to join the protectors against the betrayers in this second war. It goes badly, but she manages to convince Tiamat's heads to fight against each other, some for her and some against, and with her Patron's help, only one head, Isendra, remains, which allies with Lady Black.
Faust takes control of the power vaccum of the lightwood.
Faust trains Morgana, but Morgana eventually joins the Archfey Lucy and sets a dragon on Gallio.
Gallio kills the dragon, a feat which he finds surprisingly easy. He worries the archfey travelling with him set the dragon on him to distract him from something.
