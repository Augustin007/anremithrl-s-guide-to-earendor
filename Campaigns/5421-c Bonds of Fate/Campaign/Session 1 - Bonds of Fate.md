Ekenon is a tiefling who serves his great grandfather Beelzebub. As Tartarus begun his plotting, Beelzebub, not trusting his new master's intentions, told Ekenon to travel to Xyrdakul and establish himself there and gain power. The goal is to open a gate to bring his layer of hell down into the material plane.

Ekenon travels there with his familiar Kalquend and quickly establishes himself as a master swordsmith. Making connections to an anarchist political movement in secret, whilst also connecting himself to various political parties.

He takes on Evenon, a large and powerful "anarchist" (Who doesn't know enough about what's going on to actually _be_ an anarchist, but the anarchist organisation knows him, and he hates the government) with very little brain, as a bodyguard as he is invited to very important party.
