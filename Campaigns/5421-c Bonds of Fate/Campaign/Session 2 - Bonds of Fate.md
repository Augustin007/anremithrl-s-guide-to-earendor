[[Session 1 - Bonds of Fate |<-prev]]
The Festival of Drakzhal, leading up to midwinter, is one of the most important festivals, lasting nine days. 

Meeting with his host, Val'thu'nax 


In the frozen north of Foedus are several kingdoms. Stuck in Auril's eternal winter and defending against her forces, while cut off from supplies, and caught in a land debate between the most influential houses, an uneasy truce with the Durinic dwarves, and the civil war in the country directly to the south, sending refugees into their land, the kingdom of Xyrdakul is in perilous state. 

Beelzebub has his warlock Ekenon and Ekenon's clueless bodyguard servant Evenon to attempt to use this chaos for his own gain. He does not trust Tartarus, and does not follow blindly, and hopes to get himself and his servants to this side of the trees of Sanctuary before Tartarus can take action, and ideally help stop Tartarus, and defeat Auril, in order to be the sole divine power in the mortal plane, protected from the other gods by the trees. 

His warlock Ekenon once made a deal to become the most accomplished swordsmith in the world, and is now a famous swordsmith with minor political sway in Xyrdakul. He secretly works with a political party that promotes anarchy and the dismantling of the ineffective government that he blames for the state of the country. 

He is attending a political ball, a ball for an important draconic festival, the most prestigious one he's ever been invited to, by a member of the king's small council, in return for a sword of his smithing, the Master of Coin, Lord of house Tharaxion and all of it's holdings, Lord Val'thu'nax Tharaxion.

He has failed to make a good impression on the Master of War, Lord Ny'shar Vur'then'tar, who is involved in a long dispute with house Rashauri. 

Evenon has seperated from Ekenon and is making a fool of himself while drinking in the party bellow.
