Commander Alaric, a brother of the Order of Names, a militant order dedicated to protecting the Sanctuary, is assigned to the reinforcement, command, and protection of a small fortress called Mirai, which is currently under siege, as the previous commander died. Mirai holds one of the critical passes through into the sanctuary valley.

Alaric is given three further members of the Order of Names, Sister Seraphina, Brother Thorne, and Brother Kael, to aid in the reinforcement. All are Namesworn.

They send Thorne ahead with messages and begin preparations while more of the equipment is brought by the others.

They go as fast as they can manage, encountering a few frostforms they fight off and some giants they deceive, reaching Mirai and being welcomed by Brother Rennic.
