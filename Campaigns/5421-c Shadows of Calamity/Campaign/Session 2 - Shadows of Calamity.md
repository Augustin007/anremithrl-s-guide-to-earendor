They enter and start helping the wounded. Alaric forces Kael to rest. Seraphina checks the wards. Thorne and Alaric discuss strategy.

They discuss collapsing the ice shelf. It's typically used to run ambushes and the like, but they are down to 50 men, and it provides a way under the fortress. Reinforcements, and only forty of them, don't arrive for another week.

Reference to Tar'id'lion'nil's occupation help place this in time between 11th and 16th of Hammer.

They attempt a small operation to defend against scrying, but it gets torn apart easily. They realise they're working against Bechel of Bharam.

Eventually Alaric returns to sleep while Seraphina teaches and restores the wards and Thorne sends a squad to collapse the tunnels.

Alaric sends a message back informing the Namesworn that Bechel is allied with Auril.
