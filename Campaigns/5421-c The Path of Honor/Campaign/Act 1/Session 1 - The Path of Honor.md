Thalai Elanthino and Naras Vorasthar are prisoners of war-turned-slaves bought by a necromancer. They are the only two left. 

Talor is a hermit living in the woods.

Auril's storms are sweeping the land.

 Thalai and Naras attempt to escape the necromancer's lair, taking some of his stuff. Triggering the necromancer's magical defences.

Talor, lost in the storms finds an escaping Thalai and Naras and helps them in their escape. Thalai gets killed by an animated statue but Talor and Naras get away. The two have no languages in common.

Talor and Naras make it to Talor's hut, near which they find the unconscious gnome Ahktos Nestore. 

Ahktos acts as a translator between the two, but often lies or misleads in his translations, they realise what he is up to and tie him up and force him to swear an unbreakable oath to not act with intent to decieve with them. 

The cabin is slowly breaking under the weight of the snow.

Naras re-summons Syl, a Spirit-genasi (Sometimes mistakenly referred to as a ghost.) allowing him to again use his spell spheres.

Naras discovers the tampering of the letters and insists on informing the recipient and sender as soon as the storm dies down.

[[The Earthquake]] occurs and the cabin falls apart.
