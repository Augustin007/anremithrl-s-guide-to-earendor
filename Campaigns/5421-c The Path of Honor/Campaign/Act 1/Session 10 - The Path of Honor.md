[[Session 9 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Talor's Dragon

Talor sees a vision of his homeland. The Lightwood, as it was then called. He sees the battle he fled. He sees the remains of where he lived, his home. He sees some of the bugbears still live.
He sees the lake. His place. He sits, seeing the forest reflected in the lake.
He's been talking with the dragon. The conversation ends like this:
"Did your home deserve to be abandoned?"
"No."
"You left."
"I would have died."
"You don't know that. Not all was lost. Some survived. Some of your home still remains. Were those who died in it's defense wrong to stay?"
"This isn't fair."
"Answer."
""
"Were they wrong?"
"No."
And the dragon leaves him staring at the lake for a long time, until he gets up and the vision vanishes, and he is back in the caves, alone.

He continues down the path to the underdark. Meeting Serin Rathir. She seems unchanged, if possible, she seems quieter.
Torquil figures out when and where the next Greenclad meeting will be.
Torquil notices Liriel Danstal is reading a [[Book of Abraham the Mage|book]] that seems to be affecting her. 
Liriel, because of Torquil, no longer trusts the adults.
They're trying to talk about it to her but she seems agitated. Torquil invokes Tartarus just as Talor and Serin enter the room and rejoin the party.
The invocation of Tartarus causes the book to react. Torquil instinctively protects himself from negative energy and kills the poisonous fauna around the room, restoring Talor's life force, using Bahamut's power.
Syl identifies the book as a copy of the codex of Abraham the mage. The original was split into many pieces, but before this, a necromancer named Volthor made a singular copy. This copy was then recopied three times. Those are the four copies of the Codex.
She claims the book was given to her by her dragon. She tries to bolt.
Talor blocks off her escape and they manage to take the book from Liriel with her whole backpack, and Naras goes to destroy it. Naras is overcome by the book and is convinced to not destroy it, instead wanting to read and study it. He *is* an archivist, after all. 
Talor tries to get everyone to eat.
Syl rushes to help Naras just as Torquil is trying to calm Liriel down. Liriel blames him for invoking Tartarus, saying the book is not evil. Torquil accidentally awakens a grey ooze which blocks off the cave, but Syl frees Naras from the book before it completes its hold over him. 
The ooze is hard to destroy, and it damages Aric's dagger and nearly kills him. It swallows Syl and Talor's staff. Naras manages to destroy it by disintegrating it using Chaos.

Lirel asks for her stuff back, but it is refused.
They eat.
Torquil attends the greenclad meeting, where he enters a zone of truth and speaks with Vildara Sable, a primogen of the Greenclad, loyal only to Tormac. Vildara quickly tricks Torquil into giving up the officer robes for the region of Gnomes'helm, and then strips him of Greenclad status, claiming she should kill him for not being loyal to Tormac, and for his false ascension. To be forgiven, he has to kill one man named Mardor. 
Torquil wants to go kill the man, but Naras talks him into at least meeting the man first. On the way, Liriel steals back her backpack and seperates from the group.
Torquil finds that it is a young man, who cares for his grandfather, and is moral and righteous. Naras helps Torquil choose the right thing.
They warned the man and helped give him resources to go into hiding and stuff.

---
They find Liriel, who is now even more obviously influenced by the Codex. After a brief struggle, Talor manages to restrain her and Naras secures the book, making sure not to touch it.
