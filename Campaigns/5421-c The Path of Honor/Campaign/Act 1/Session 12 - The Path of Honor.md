Caxius Maeor is a Tiefling from Rymfel. She grew in the slums of the most crime infested city of the world. She became a bounty hunter and assasin after her mother was killed protecting them from trafickers. When her brother was kidnapped, she set after him. She is lost in the underdark, having lost the trail, when she hears the loud crash of the cave ceiling collapsing. 
She investigates, and spooked, shoots Torquil and flees. She's quickly caught and disarmed by the superior number. She attempts to escape again but Aric tackles her and disarms her again. After some amount of talking, they reach a semi-truce.

They decide to share food and rest once together before each going their own way.

At this time, Krag, Ranor, and Dareth arrive at the cave. Caxius is ready to attack them instantly but Aric tackles her again. Liriel makes a play for the book but is stopped by Naras. 

Crag is informed about the letter, but passes out from the poison, and is locked into The Mirror of Life Trapping to save his life.

Ranor inspects the book and figures it is safe enough, but Dareth disagrees. Ranor notes the conveniently dead ropers and takes some shavings off their tentacles.
