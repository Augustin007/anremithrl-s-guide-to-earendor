[[Session 14 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Caxius's picture of her kidnapped brother who she's been looking for for the last year, which fell off the necklace last session, is in pocket of her clothes, which are in her bag. Which was taken from her.

Caxius is taken to the court of the seven lords of Carabran. She defends her case but the lords sentence her to execution. 

Talor is questioned by the police and sentence to labor at the pit. 

Naras decides to take Dareth's equipment, and rests a bit before re-summoning Syl. Since she is in the dark regions, the Darkness of Shar clings to her, and in her re-summoning rolls across Carabran. Causing despondance, despair, anger, fear, hatred, and death. The darkness clings to creatures, starting to form new Abberations. 

Naras decides to rest some more before seeking out the kids. As he falls asleep he hears one last thing, the sound of a hummingbird, the words "Sckeeo teners ou pethleen thlon".
