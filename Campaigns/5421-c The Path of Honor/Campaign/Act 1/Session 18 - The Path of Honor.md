[[Session 17 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]
As Ivvan and Naras break into the prison with Liriel, killing a pair of guards on the way in and hiding in the stone, the other four fight and kill another pair of guards.

Uncim uses his shapeshifting to get some guards to approach the rest, in a final part of an escape attempt, but it quickly falls apart, and Uncim manages to escape and head into a bar run by his friend Vraelis.

Talor, Torquil, and Drithen come up with the idea to start a wider prison break to escape in the chaos. Drithen frees Gozog, a mass murderer, while Talor and Torquil begin freeing others, killing guards and trying to obtain more keys. 

As everything begins to go into lockdown, Drithen is seperated from everyone in a far corridor, two cells further up seeming occupied, Talor and Torquil are by the enterance. In front of them, blocked by blade barriers (blocking every block, passageway, etc.), are the main contingent of guards. They hit Talor with crossbows. Gozog is rampaging through the coartyard, getting closer and closer to Serin, who Torquil notices standing in the courtyard. He convinces the rats to try to slow down Gozog.
