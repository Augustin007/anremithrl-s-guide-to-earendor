[[Session 21 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Torquil Leogan is bound by his unbreakable oaths, and his mind involuntarily reaches out and contacts Voren.

The Voice in giggles speaks up: 'She is coming. I must not be here.' And his presence fades.

The party watch as the heat around them is sucked into Torquil, depositioning the air around him. Auril is freezing him and keeping him alive and safe for the pick up. Ivvan turns into an owl and tries to flee the cold. 
Naras, realising what is happening, tries to use Syl to free Torquil, and she is expelled from the plane. He then tries to use one of the other blades, which he pulls from the bag of holding, which has a momentary presence of The Voice and flees, and the blade shatters against the ice. 

Auril and her forces arrive. Slaughtering the encampment. 

The children are trapped inside a building and Ivvan rushes in. Aric is carrying the dead body of Kerran, trying to break the ice as it forms. Lirien is trying to warm up and Liriel is trying to calm Serin down, who has bits of darkness coalescing around her. Ivvan tries to help them escape, to no avail.

Voren attacks and knocks out Naras, but is stopped by Talor, who beats him and flings him away with his giant sword.

Torquil calls on Fizban and they share possession of Torquil's body. Together, they both choose to aid and protect, casting protection spells and healing spells, melting the ice. In the light of Fizban, Giggles melts away into shadow. 

Tarnil's guard has died, and they see him fighting a pair of elementals. Naras rushes to help him. 

Ivvan tries to usher the children to escape as Talor tries to calm Serin down.

Fizban wants Torquil to flee. To stay away from Auril, but Torquil wants to attack. Their wills diverge and the possession ends.
Liriel slaps Torquil and blames him for this, telling everyone the truth of the oaths, as Auril snatches the two of them up. Torquil finally realises the gravity of the situation, and gives Liriel his shortsword, (a dagger to her) and orders her to kill him.

She complies in shock, depriving Auril of the knowledge Torquil was carrying.

Auril leaves in anger, carrying Liriel, and with her, the Codex of Abraham the Mage. Dri'ros tells the king to flee, as the rest of the party also begins to flee south, led by Ivvan.
