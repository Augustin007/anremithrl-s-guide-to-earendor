[[Session 3 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

They meet Binch, who semi-befriends Ahktos. Naras dislikes him at first, but Binch purchases horses for them to reach [[Gnomes'helm]]. 
Ahktos seperates himself from the group to meet with the [[Greenclad]]. He sees [[The Hidden Order]] has killed the Greenclad leader but he is captured before he can do anything. He hides his money and talks to Voren, agreeing to lure the remnants of the Greenclad to death. Ahktos's friend Bathar senses the trap and tries to help Ahktos escape, but they are both caught.
Naras, Syl, and Talor try to track down Krag but find he left three days ago. They encounter Voren but realise they don't have the power to stop him.
They talk to the authorities in Gnomes'helm and garner the help of the [[Silvercloaks]] and the [[Kinais]], this leads to an attack on Voren's party and Voren barely gets away with Ahktos and his best friend. He convinces Ahktos to swear himself to Auril and gives him a secret mission. To prove his loyalty he makes Ahktos kill his best friend Bathar, which Ahktos does.
