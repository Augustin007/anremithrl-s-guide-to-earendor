[[Session 6 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Talor attempts to ask at the city hall about Krag, but also recieves no answer.
A flighty Torquil gets spooked by the antimagic and runs away, causing him to get arrested and foiling Naras's revenge against his former master. Naras instead grudgingly causes mass confusion and saves Torquil. 
Torquil secretly gives a message to someone, given to him by Voren. His mind is then wiped.
Syl meets dragonborn wizard Tal'berius Tar'rillion in his [[Architect's Sanctum]], where the cracked orb of annhilation [[Second Shattering|is releasing Chaos]] and he attempts to contain it. 
They are trying to regroup when the dragon Tormac, leader of the Greenclad, comes in and attacks the city. Torquil is knocked out by debris. When Talor tries to feed him a healing potion, it turns out Torquil (who made the potions) had actually poisoned them to harm the other two. Torquil starts getting worse because of his own poison. Naras, meanwhile, sets up a protective sphere and allows children inside to help them live. These are mostly human, as the Aaracokra in the region flew away from the toxic fumes. 
The dragon notices Torquil in Magister-Greenclad robes and heals him just before Naras and Syl finish both ends of a teleportation spell. Since it can teleport eight people, Naras teleports himself, Talor, Torquil, and five children. An older boy, an older girl, a young boy and a young girl, and a four year old boy who is dying from the poisonous fumes. 
Torquil uses his knowledge of Alchemy to save the four-year-old. The older boy is very protective of the other young boy, who is his brother, and is asking what is going on. Syl follows Tal'berius and watches the Eye of Vecna be stolen from his vault by Kas and Tahlia.
Naras trades his last drops of pure order to Tal'berius, helping him contain the Chaos a little longer. Tal'berius gives him a bag of holding with money, food, and other supplies. Tal'berius gives them information on Krag, and Syl flies to [[Bremen]] to prepare a teleport.
Torquil casts a spell and the eight are immediately thrown out of the Architect's Sanctum.
Torquil begins to fly to Bremen using a spell, not knowing Naras and Syl are preparing a teleport. The other seven teleport to just outside the city.
