Naras is separated from the group without realising in the snow. Aric wants to go back for Liriel. Tarnil calls Talor a 'Wagon Burner', but Talor doesn't seem to much care. Giggles rematerialises near the party. The Voice has not returned. Nearby, a pair of twins, Uldren and Qorneth, lost in the snow, overhear the conversation, and Qorneth climbs a tree to see. They are detected by Ivvan's Psionics. Qorneth is detected and held by Serin, and falls out of a tree just as Ivvan warns about them. Tarnil lifts Qorneth with his gauntlet by the throat and questions him while Talor and Aric subdue Uldren. When Tarnil threatens Qorneth, the twins try to break free at once and fail. The people discuss whether or not to kill them, as they might be spies from ... any number of their enemies. Talor, Ivvan, and Lirien argue for sparing them. Aric argues for killing them and being done with it. Serin is crying. The party devolves into arguing until they hear the sound of approaching wolves. Frost-forms of wolves attack them, tackling Tarnil. Giggles uses his magic to turn them against each other, and protects Aric from a wolf. Serin snaps and dissolves into darkness. She tears apart two of the wolves and chases after a fleeing one. In the chaos, Uldren and Qorneth try to flee, but Qorneth's hood falls, revealing his tattoo, and he goes back for it and the two are caught again.
