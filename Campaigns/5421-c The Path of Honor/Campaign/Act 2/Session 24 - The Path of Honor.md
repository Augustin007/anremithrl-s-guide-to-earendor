Naras finds everyone else and hides out with them. He resummons syl, bringing back Aeofie with her. Aeofie offers them a deal with Azmodeus and when they refuse, spares them for bringing her back.
Qorneth makes a vow to Talor to serve him in exchange for protection.

Naras arrived at camp and begins to resummon Syl. Meanwhile Qorneth and Talor talk. In the Shadowfell, Syl is immediately captured by a redheaded humanoid adult with freckles, who seems to be thousands of years old, and ties her soul to Syl to be resumed with her. The figure identifies herself as The Shadow, and seems to be pro-second sundering. The two are dragged into the material plane by Naras when he summons Syl. The Shadow spares them since they took her from the dark region, and offers them a position under Asmodeus. When they refuse, she says next time they meet her, they won't be that lucky, and disappears. Naras talks to Qorneth after discovering he's also a slave, but they're both off-putting and dislike each other. Talor manages to talk to Qorneth and they agree to swear oaths to not harm each other, and that Talor will protect the twins and they'll serve him as vassals under oath. With Naras's guidance they enact this oath.
