Ivvan frees Naras in the night, since the party planned to execute him and he disagreed. 

Qorneth has visions. In the end he sees a hook-handed man, who speaks to him. 

Aric tries to warn the camp and make as much noise as possible. Ivvan tries to stop him. Aric is possessed by the Darkness that is, and breaks through his bonds and shatters Ivvan's saber. After a conversation with the other two, the Darkness leaves Aric and Aric passes out.

Ivvan steals stuff from Tarnil and keeps this secret from Naras.
