Ormund
Slaver 2

Halva


Naras and Ivvan speak to Aileen some more before retreating to bed. The next day, Naras catches Halva as she runs off while Ivvan speaks to Beric and his family. Naras, Ivvan and two guards go after Halva. They encounter two slavers who put them all to sleep with a sleep spell.

As they are being driven away, Ivvan pretends to be deadly sick and they abandon him in the ice and snow. He manages to break out of his shackles and rejoin the group.

Liriel gets herself captured too.

They reach a mining encampment where they are all sold.
