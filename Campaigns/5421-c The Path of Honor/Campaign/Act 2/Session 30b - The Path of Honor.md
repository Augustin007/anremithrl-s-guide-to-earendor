Lei'ros, son of Tarnil, is regrouping in the Deathwood. Arthur helps command the troops and organise a council-meeting. They struggle to figure out supply lines and what to do about Kharazien's approaching army and the other doings of other known contenders for thrones. Particularly Kharazien, The Five, Faust, and Grelzia. They worry whether Tarnil was able to get Aka'vral's support.

Aka'vral arrives, announcing Tar'nil's death, which shakes Lei'ros, and opening new supply lines from Riulva for the army.

Aka'vral takes Sir Calren back to his tent to discuss politics after the meeting, who supported him in the meeting, though much of Lei'ros's council disliked Aka'vral. After a while, he sidetracks from politics and teaches him basketball, Aka'vral's newly invented game.
