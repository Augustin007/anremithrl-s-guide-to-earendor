[[Session 30b - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Lei'ros is coronated following his father's death. Lei'ros is depressed. Basketball spreads throughout the camps. Arthur is named hand of the king to Lei'ros, replacing Aka'vralin a more official context.\

They spend a week travelling back to Riulva, planning to regroup there and hold against Kharazien and possibly prepare to siege the Perch, when the Shattering occurs. They head over to investigate and witness the last few seconds of the Shattering and the beginning of the Age of Ash. They stay clear away from Tal'berius. Arthur considers taking the Conduit, not knowing what it is, but chooses not to after approaching it and sensing a lot of power emanating. As they leave the hill where they saw the end of the Shattering from, they are stopped by Ashariel, the ascended Ashdilkir.
