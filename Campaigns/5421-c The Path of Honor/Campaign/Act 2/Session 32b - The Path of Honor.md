After a brief conversation with Ashariel, they encounter and save a man disguised as Lord Edward IV of Dragonvale, and four men. "Edward" promises to kill five people for them for the five people they saved. "Edward" is forced to take a new body as several of his bones are broken and he takes on the form of a recently killed dragonborn he sees at the hospital, taking on the name Dan'ul.

Aftereffects of the shattering ripple through the air, burning through the ley lines, Draconic Ash falls from the sky, Great earthquakes fell taller buildings worldwide, causing chaos in places like The Perch, Suptyu, and Veloria. With the Tree gone, several gods have descended into the plane. Auril's death at the hands of Liriel Danstal means that the eternal winter is over. Thalorin's awakening has destroyed much of the Order of Names. Beelzebub has conquered Xyrdakul, Gallio's death has fragmented what remains of the NAF. DragonArrow's new shipping monopoly has drastically increased prices as the world suddenly cannot trade via the other routes. Millions of people worldwide are dead in only the first few hours, but the ashfall, destroying crops, threatens a great famine.

The council discusses this, before deciding to side with Beelzebub in the north. Aka'vral and Arthur are both invited to the first formalised basketball tournament organised by the brand new Northern Basketball Armada (NBA). "Dan'ul" shows up as well, staying close to the two people he owes five lives to. There is an attempt to assasinate Arthur, Aka'vral and "Dan'ul" kill him. Arthur's honor guard finds a assination contract on his body signed by Aka'vral, but cannot verify whether it is a fake or not, and who sent the assasin. 

Arthur and Aka'vral decide to take 35 men on an excursion north, keeping the rest of the army under Lei'ros at Riulva to fend of Kharazien.
