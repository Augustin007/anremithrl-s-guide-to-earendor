Ivvan takes over Szinvorn's identity and demands from Lord Lucian  the freedom of the slave captured at the same time as him, referring to Naras. Szinvorn returns Serin, who Ivvan hadn't known was captured. Ivvan and Serin bond as they wait for a formal dinner with the slavers. 

Ivvan speaks with Sebastian Valerius and the Sons of Honor, negotiating a deal to keep open slave trading lines as long as they need to move slaves through there, in return for 1/20th of the value of the moved slaves.

After some more conversation Ivvan takes a carriage through the blink carriage. 

Pretending Serin is his slave, Serin is good at pretending to be a slave, he makes his way through, speaking with what seems to be Szinvorn's advisor. Ivvan does not know his own palace and quickly gets lost. He takes one of the servants, a young boy named Aegreth who is moving silverware and plates, and forces Aegreth to lead him to Szinvorn's chambers. At Serin's insistence to keep things secret, they dunk him in water several times while Serin and Ivvan talk and plan how they will stay alive and figure this out. 

A lady arrives and Ivvan attempts to talk to her outside. She seems to be close to Szinvorn, immune to telepathy, and seems to figure out something is off. She says she'll see him at the ceremony and leaves, seeming insulted and suspicious.
