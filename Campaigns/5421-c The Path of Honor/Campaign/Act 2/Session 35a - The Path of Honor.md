They reenter the tunnels. Now with Syl, Naras is able to detect magic to learn more about the stellatite and mining. Leren trains Tepozo on the equipment, the equipment uses the the Stellatite geodes that are too small to refine.  These can make poor batteries which are primed for Draconic quiddity and used to create Forcewalls to cut up chunks of stone for the mining. 

Most of the stellatite that is in the tunnels has mild traces of divine magic. 

Syl begins signaling from the top, snow meaning now and leafs meaning yes.

As they head up, Naras is more keenly aware of several quiddity fields on the way up, meant to antimagic things as they go up. Naras thinks about this while Tepozo and Leren talk. 

Tepozo and Leren invite the bald darker skinned Cherhai man who corrected Tepozo before into of their group. They notice offhandly that Dundarion is gone. The bald man is Nirhak, and deeply knowledgable. They consider different escape plans.
