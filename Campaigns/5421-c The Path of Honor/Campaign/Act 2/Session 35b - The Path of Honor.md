A Taxblade is brought into the room just as Taelarden is going to complete the assasination. Taelarden's cover is blown and he shoots the queen non-fatally in the chaos. The taxblade begins attacking Taelarden. Aka'vral and Arthur refuse Beelzebub's deal and go back south. They discover via a small messanger group sent north that Lei'ros has committed suicide. Lord Calren has taken his own portion of the troops and disbanded it. Dri'ros is holding forces in the Drak'zhal. Lei'ros's younger brother is the new figurehead of the group whilst in Dri'ros's hold. Thauric attempts to hold morale in southern Riulva, but infighting has begun. Kharazien is besieging the Perch. There is no news of Faust. The group reach Kyrgma and stop there.
