Aemma sits next to a man at the [[Mountainside Tavern]]. After striking up a conversation with the stranger, she finds out his name is Tarold.

She discovers he joined the [[Neroshi Adventuring Guild]] in an attempt to gain visa to enter Neros, as Tarold is Rymfelli. Ideally, of course, he would like citizenship. Aemma jokingly offers to marry him, and they laugh at the joke.

Tarold explains he was travelling with a contact to try to get into the country of Neros illegally, until they got ambushed by bandits at Nar pass, near the capital. His contact got killed and Tarold was wounded, but able to heal himself magically just enough to make it to the border city of Lanar. Once the first round of paperwork was done, he travelled with a band of merchants for a few weeks

In order to gain passage into Neros, Tarold joined the Adventuring Guild, a process expidited by his time as a highly-payed marked Bounty-Hunter in Rymfel. Now, he's trying to read through mountains of paperwork to try to understand what he needs to do, and what legalities he has. In general, he understands that he isn't cleared to adventure without a citizen of Neros marked as travelling with him.

Tarold observes that Aemma's gear is cheap and new, and not well put together and surmises she is new to adventuring. After some conversation, he finds out she has an academy license, not a collegiate one, which means that her previous marks were unsanctioned. She also isn't marked to travel alone.

After some conversation, they agree to work together. Tarold thinks her knowledge of traditions, geography, languages, and cultures needs a lot of work, and states she needs to get better at it under his tutelage.

Aemma is scared about her previous marks, but Tarold has her retroactively add him as a companion and thus legitimise them. This serves him because he now has enough missions to be considered a member, and thus apply for citizenship. He submits the application.

He has her fetch the guild paper, explaining he has platinum rank from the transfer from the bounty-hunting guild, so they can take pretty much any, and having her use his guild coin take a goldsheet. 

After deciding to take an unusually well-priced goldsheet quest, the rescue of a Solenthiri princess., kidnapped by the [[Dreamers of Bharam]] After realising the royal family payed the guild, they ask for 500gp instead of 300gp. When it's accepted easily, they realise the Royal Family payed a negotiation fee way above this, and the guild is pocketing the difference. Since they already accepted the quest marker, though, they can't negotiate the fee any more.

Tarold sends Aemma to buy the materials for the quest, including better gear for her, while he buys a horse for her and prepares it for the jouney.

When they're ready, they set out.

Tarold uses a magical ring to summon a steed of light.

Away they go.
