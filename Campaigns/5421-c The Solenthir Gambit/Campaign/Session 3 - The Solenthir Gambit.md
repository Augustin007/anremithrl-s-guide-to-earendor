[[Session 2 - The Solenthir Gambit |<-prev]]
Tarold decides to double back and try the Endelwine again. The North is clearly far too dangerous, now.

They begin doubling back. Tarold coaches her on Karish, the language of Karr and of Rymfel, his own native language.

They're interrupted by Auril's frost forms. The eyes of the Silven Crown. 

They try to pass without fighting, but they're attacked by the frostforms, imitations of creatures fromed of ice and snow, who appear to be trying to stop them from returning to Neros. 

Six wolves and two bears. 

Tarold tries to teleport them away with his blink ring, but it fails. He cuts through them and manages takes the spell keeping one of them together as it reforms. Green flame blade is used to keep them at bay.

Aemma and Tarold break away from the frost-forms and flee. Aemma's horse is left behind and the frostforms go for it. Tarold uses a firebolt to activate the explosives on the horse, killing it and harming the frost-forms, giving them more time to get away.

Tarold starts a flight spell, but he's a few moments too slow and is interrupted by the wolves and brought down. After some struggling Aemma comes in and saves him.

He orders Aemma to run as he holds them off, stating he has a plan. She disobeys and dashes in, preventing him from using fireball for fear of killing her, he is forced to dash in and help her, and he uses his position as proctor over her to compel her to obey, which uses up his concentration and doesn't let him cast a spell. 

Tarold fights at these frost forms, accruing injuries. He charms one into fighting the others to get a moment of reprieve. Once she gets out, he drops a fireball on them and himself, tanking the damage himself. 

He passes out. Aemma goes back and uses his ring to summon the light-steed, she loads him onto the horse and the rides back across the southern border of Drakenthorne into the warmth of Neros. Armor is severely damaged.
