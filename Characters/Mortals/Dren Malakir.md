Dren Malakir was born into the gutters of Kethras. His mother, a healer, practiced illegal blood magic in the slums, hired by different gangs to perform healings, curses, or poisons.

The streets raised Dren just as much as his mother did. He learned how to steal before he could read, how to run before he could fight, and how to lie before he could trust. His mother did her best to shield him from the brutality of the underworld, but she could not hide the truth: power was the only currency that mattered.

When he was nine, he saw his mother killed.

Alone and afraid, he fended for himself, occasionally trying, from his hazy memory, some of the rituals his mother had done. The magic that exploded out of him was dangerous and uncontrollable, but seductive and powerful to him as a scared child.

He used this magic in anger, without conscious choice, to curse and kill the man who slit his mother's throat. He heard about this days later, listening in fascination and horror about how the man's body had twisted and ruptured from within.

At sixteen, he found an old hedge-witch willing to teach him for a price.

He worked for gangs for some time, trying to gain enough coin to buy a lesson.

One lesson after another over the course of years, he slowly began to master himself.

One rule he kept, he would not harm a child, nor would he kill the mother of a child.

For this rule, when he was twenty-five, he refused a job. And incensed, the gang tracked him down, and kidnapped the hedge-witch, threatening to kill her. Beaten, he commited the task and they killed her anyways. He fled in guilt and horror, and worked for a few years as a smuggler, concealing his magic.

A decade later, he watched at a slavers market as a mother and son were separated, enraged, he attacked the slaver. His magic slipped out as he killed the slaver brutally. He was subdued, and sentenced, but a man of the Sol'karis, named Edrin Vel, vouched for him, and he escaped. Edrin convinced him to join the Sol'karis in atonement for his sins after the two travelled together for some time. He gained a mentor with the Sol'karis, an old mage named Talis Malnor.

Despite the Sol’karis’ protection, Dren never truly felt like he belonged. He was resented by some of the order, who saw him as a criminal they had foolishly taken in. Over the years, he grew in wisdom, but his survival instinct never truly left him. A man named Vorlin Talvas sought kinship with him, as he saw the two of them as similar, but he never really liked Vorlin.

He kept a correspondence with Edrin until Edrin died in 5418 AS. At one point he met Xalvor, Edrin's new apprentice.

In Edrin's honour, after hearing Xalvor volunteer for the mission, he, too volunteered.
