Personal Intelligent Network Efficient Adaptive Processing Logic (PINE-APL) (Construct, Artificer (Artilerist) 14) The last player is PINE-APL, an advanced AI made of a combination of magic and engineering. He became sentient when the god Nebelum granted him sentience after being impressed with the engineering that made him work. He joined the party through the inspiration of Nebelum, though he does not know it, after coming across Nugget and Colossus in the woods. Though many people don’t really believe he is sentient, he doesn’t really seem to care about the opinions of others. 

In the battle at the tree of names, he killed himself in an attempt to stop Colossus from stealing the name.
