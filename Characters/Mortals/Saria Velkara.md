Saria was the daughter of a minor gang leader in the criminal underworld of Rymfel.

Her mother died when Saria was a child, assassinated by a rival gang, and her father raised her with little affection or patience.

She was taught and learned that she needed power and ruthlessness to survive, and that mercy was a weakness. 

Her magic manifested with puberty, flickers of sorcery tied to the heat of her blood, uncontrolled and dangerous. 

Her father feared it. Hoping to turn it to his benefit, he bade her to master it. She practiced in secret, learning from different bloodthirsty and depraved mages in the underworld, offering coin, secrets, her body, and whatever else to learn what snippets she could.

Saria took to the magic like she took to violence—with discipline, precision, and purpose. She devoured spellbooks, memorized every incantation, and taught herself to control and shape fire in ways no one had achieved.

By the time she was eighteen, she was working as an enforcer, collecting debts, intimidating rivals, and burning down buildings when necessary. 

One night, a rival gang struck, killing her father and many of her people. She fled south to Trixail, and began trying solo robberies, and hiring herself out as an assasin.

With the law hot on her tail, she was constantly on the run.

It was in this time she had an encounter with lady Niamh Moonwatcher.

Saria arrived at a Sol’karis hall by accident, injured from a fight in a city where she had overstayed her welcome. She had no love for do-gooders, for soft-hearted mages who played at wisdom while the world burned. But they offered asylum to any who sought it, and she was out of options.

She was given shelter, food, and medical aid. The kindness unsettled her. She distrusted their motives, yet she stayed.

For the first time in her life, she was surrounded by people who wielded magic not as a weapon, but as a tool for healing, for knowledge, for protection. She mocked them for their naivety, for their blind faith in goodness—but she could not bring herself to leave.

Despite her admiration for their knowledge, she never fully accepted their ways. Mercy and trust were luxuries she could not afford. The Sol’karis saw potential in her, but she saw them as idealists who had never been burned the way she had.

Still, she owed them a debt.

So when rumors of Hechilspet’s cult reached the Sol’karis, she did what no one expected. She volunteered.
