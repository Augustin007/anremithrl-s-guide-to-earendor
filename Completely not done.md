Isle of Abbey - I didn't run it, I played in it. I want to ask John for his own session notes? But I also know he ran a modified pre-written campaign

Adventures in Arthulion - So many sessions, and a vast section on paper no less. Also some are missing, but I vaguely remember.

Tale of Lorekeep - ...just been lazy, actually. 

Origins of the Greenclad - Even more sessions, and all on paper. Some are missing, including the entire last act? I think I recall seperating it.

Rise of the Greenclad - I didn't take very consistent notes, I barely remember what happened for some reason. Some notes are gone? Why can't I find them? Still on paper.

Crew of the Tyr - I didn't run it. Three different people ran it. I wasn't even in it, only as a liason to the official lore of the world. I know it was planned to run for four sessions, (A one shot,) and it was John's first attempt at DMing, but he quickly gave up and decided to run Isle of Abbey since it was prewritten, and one of the players took over, then they got Stroman to do it, so I don't even know whether it actually ran for all four sessions?

Shadows of Calamity - ...laziness, again. Just need to track the notes down and give them a once-over. 

UNNNAMED - Need to talk to DM for that one. Also needs name.
