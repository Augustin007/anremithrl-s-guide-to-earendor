The Hive of [[Beholders of Swanward]] was ruled by a powerful queen named Dacre. She was a giant beholder summoned by [[Nadek]]. She oversaw the hive's operations from the depths of her lair, which lay hidden deep within the Boleyn cave system. During her reign, the hive grew in power and enslaved whole cities. However, when [[Miyatol Dodonus]] enlisted the help of his friends [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] and [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] in driving away the  beholders, Miyatol was able to strike the finishing blow on Queen Dacre, and the hive dispersed across the land.
