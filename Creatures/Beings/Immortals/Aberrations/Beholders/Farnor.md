Farnor is an ancient and powerful beholder of the [[Beholders of Swanward]] that was captured by [[Lord Theodore Nott]] and [[Lord Edward Dragonvale]] during the [[Lek'qer]] War. It was one of many that attacked EÃ¤rendor, but it was particularly notable due to its immense size and strength.

The capture of Farnor had a significant impact on the war effort against the Lek'qer. Its unique abilities and powers made it an invaluable asset to Lord Nott and Lord Dragonvale. The two lords were able to use Farnor to great effect, including using its eye beams to destroy enemy strongholds and other strategic targets.

The beholder eventually escaped captivity and attacked a nearby city before being slain by a [[Scathatch|mysterious figure]].
