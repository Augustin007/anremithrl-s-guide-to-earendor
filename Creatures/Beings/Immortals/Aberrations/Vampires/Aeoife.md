Aeoife was the twin sister of Scathatch, and they were the daughters of the first vampires, and dangerous creatures. They devoted their lives to studying combat.

They inherited some vampiric traits.

They both loved the same man. Because of their fighting over him, they were unable to save him in a battle, and he died.

His ghost was cursed and did not leave the mortal plane, but rather was chained to the location of his death. 

His cursed soul was later used to draw the twins into a trap. The twins survived the ambush and killed their attackers and rushed to his ghost. When they spoke to him one last time, he did not tell them which of the two he had loved, but rather that he now hated them with all of his self, and tried to kill them. They refused to unmake his ghost and fled instead, leaving his chained soul behind.

The two blamed each other and went their separate ways.

After this, Aeoife traveled the world, taking on bounties and making a fortune. She used her skills to kill anyone she was payed to, and asked no questions. 

She avoided her sister. 

Eventually, she ended up in [[Veloria]], where bounty hunting was especially lucrative. She met and intensely disliked [[Valus]], who had been taught by Scathatch, and came bearing a message of reconciliation from her sister, which she denied, sending him back to tell Scathatch.

Aeoife denied several more attempts from Scathatch. Sometimes in person In the end she tried to kill [[Scathatch]] and her apprentice [[Joanna]], who overpowered her and refused to harm her, leaving her there.

Scathatch did not again attempt to contact her sister.

Aeoife would go on to meet the swordsman [[Niten]] and marry him. When he was old, she approached Valus and asked him where he had purchased his immortality. Valus refused to answer. Aeoife then attempted to track down her sister, who had granted immortality to Joanna. While she was desperately seeking Scathatch, Niten died alone in Veloria, awaiting Aeoife's return. Aeoife did not yet know this by the time she tracked down Scathatch. Scathatch refused to see her sister at first, but hearing the situation, finally agreed to speak to Aeoife. During the delay, Aeoife received the news of Niten's death, and so Aeoife fled in grief and did not meet Scathatch at the meeting place.

She continued her bounty hunting work in Veloria after this, blaming her sister that she was not there with Niten in his final moments.
