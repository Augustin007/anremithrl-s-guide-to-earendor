Drakmor-Prince Nugget Remshi, son of the Dragon King Draco-Remshi the Avenger of Deathwood Drakmor of Darkenthorne Warlock (Hexblade) 12/Paladin (Oath of Vengeance) 3: 

The dragonborn and the dwarves have long blamed each-other for the release of Auril, for much longer than the Prince has been alive they have been locked in an eternal war. He long developed an intense hatred for dwarves after his human mother was killed during a dwarven raid, and he and his soldiers were temporarily exiled from his kingdom when he refused to respect the truce during a lull in the Dwarven-Dragonborn war. 

He was gravely injured when he and a group of fellow exiled soldiers attacked a Dwarven camp, but he escaped by swearing service to Asmodeus, who cannot directly affect the mortal world, but can channel power through his servants. 

Asmodeus makes him become close to Colossus, who he knows is tied to the Raven Queen. This allows Asmodeus to collect information on the Raven Queen and the spell she used to kill his brother, which he hopes to eventually use on her, and also information on the spells that lock away the betrayer gods to the Nine Hells. Eventually the year and day of service are up, and Asmodeus drags Nugget’s soul down to the Nine Hells, leaving his body alive but in a coma above. He tortures Nugget for eight months, eventually making a deal with his Colossus to return Nugget, still holding one last favor from Nugget he cannot refuse, and for one hour of Colossus’s time, to be collected at any point. Nugget returns, now driven mad by his months of torture, and swears an oath with his entire soul, to take revenge on everyone who wronged him. He includes Auril, Azmodeus, and the Dwarves with this oath. He has killed now several innocent dwarves to fuel his revenge, and works tirelessly to stop Auril. Unbeknownst to him (and to everyone but Draco-Remshi), it was his very father, urged on by Tiamat, who cast the spell that freed Auril. He obtained the The Labyrinth Stone from Ashdilkir, an immortal girl, and used its power to sacrifice the remnants of his sanity for the strength needed to bring down Asmodeus.

He killed the Necromancer Voros Kaul with the help of Talberius.

He arrived at the tree of names alongside Sir William Treaty and Talberius, and found Lady Black already there along with her new companion Sock. 

Colossus joined him shortly afterwards, but having discovered his evil deeds, refused to speak with him.

Nugget arrived at the island on which the tree grew shortly after William did. He touched the tree and discovered the names of all the beings, and the history of the universe. In that moment he saw his error, that the dwarves were not at fault for the release of Auril. 

Asmodeus wished to take from him the name of his forgotten brother. He asked Lady Black and William Treaty to kill him to prevent the end of the world.

He cursed himself so that his ghost could communicate as much information about Auril's release to Colossus, completing his mission.

His soul returned to the material plane when Asmodeus took the souls in Nessus with him, and he was placed in an Elduinari to act as a Soul Splice for [[Aeofie]]. When the [[analyst]] disarmed aeofie, after a failed ressurection attempt, Nil'ge'tar was pushed into the dark regions to recreate Kas's ritual, and was ressurected as a vampire.
