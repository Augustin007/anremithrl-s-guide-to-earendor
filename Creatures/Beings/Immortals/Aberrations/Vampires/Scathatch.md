Scathatch was the twin sister of [[Aeoife]], and they were the daughters of the first vampires, and dangerous creatures. They devoted their lives to studying combat.

They inherited some vampiric traits.

They both loved the same man. Because of their fighting over him, they were unable to save him in a battle, and he died.

His ghost was cursed and did not leave the mortal plane, but rather was chained to the location of his death. 

His cursed soul was later used to draw the twins into a trap. The twins survived the ambush and killed their attackers and rushed to his ghost. When they spoke to him one last time, he did not tell them which of the two he had loved, but rather that he now hated them with all of his self, and tried to kill them. They refused to unmake his ghost and fled instead, leaving his chained soul behind.

The two blamed each other and went their separate ways.

After parting ways, Scathatch gathered her courage and returned to the ghost. She spoke to him as he attempted again and again to kill her until she discovered the nature of his curse. She went on a long and dangerous journey to free his soul. 

When she returned, he forgave her. She did not ask which of the two he had loved, expressing sorrow for having fought over him. They held each other in a hug until his ghost dissapated.

Scathatch proceeded to seek her sister out, trying to help as many people as possible along the way, giving away money, fighting away monsters and bandits, and giving people rides until she ended up stranded, without money or equipment, in the kingdom of Swanward.

She lived in the woods, gathering and hunting, making primitive equipment, until she was caught by the head of the ranger order, [[Herbert]]. After talking with him, he realised her prowess in combat, and offered her a job teaching apprentice rangers. She helped develop the ranger curriculum, making the Swanward rangers the deadly force they are today.

She did not like training people for stealth and subterfuge though, prefering honourable open combat, and took the job only because of her vast need for money. The moment she had enough, she quit, and returned to searching for her sister.

As she continued to travel, she took on various apprentices, who she taught her ways. Among these was [[Valus]], who eventually gained immortality and helped Scathatch finally track down her sister.

Aeoife denied all attempts at reconciliation, until Scathatch, with her new apprentice Joanna, were attacked by Aeoife, and Joanna was mortally wounded protecting Scathatch.

Scathatch overpowered her sister and left her alive, claiming that she gave up on reconciliation, and fled with Joanna's dying body. Scathatch performed a powerful work of magic to make Joanna immortal, but lost her casting ability. Scathatch then called Joanna her new sister.

Joanna would go on to marry a man named Gilmore. Scathatch warned her against falling for a mortal, but Joanna ignored Scathatch. Joanna was incapable of having children because of her wounds. Gilmore grew old, and began to die, and Scathatch and Joanna tried to save him, begging Valus for an answer of how he achieved his immortality. They were unsuccesful and Scathatch comforted Joanna in her grief.

Thereafter, Scathatch heard Aeoife was looking for her and sent her then-apprentice, a man named Prichard, to look for Aeoife and send her a message to turn her away. After some correspondence, Scathatch discovered that Aeoife was in a similar situation that Joanna was some centuries ago, and feeling pity, Scathatch agreed to meet her sister, but when she went to meet her, Aeoife was gone.

Scathatch now roams the countryside of Swanward with group of students, hunting monsters and bandits and righting wrongs.
