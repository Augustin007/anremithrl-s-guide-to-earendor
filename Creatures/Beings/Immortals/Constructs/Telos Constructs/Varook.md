The Eternal Guardian

He converted himself into a construct of stone and iron, basing it on [[Davros]]'s work, mimicking Telos. He guards the city where he lived from all dangers. He once killed a great dragon which came to the small town. He never has been known to leave.

He was eventually killed by [[Hechilspet]].
