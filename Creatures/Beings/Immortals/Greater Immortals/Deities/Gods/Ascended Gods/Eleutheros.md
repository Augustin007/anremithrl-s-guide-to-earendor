The Traveller.

During [[Hechilspet]]'s reign, Eleutheros created the [[Feywild]] to help protect his kin, transporting many of the elves and fairies there to the reign of his sister [[Lady Elmenore]]. Eventually, Eleutheros became the first Arch-fey.

He fought, defeated, and captured Hechilspet in a great duel, locking him in a [[Hechilspet's Prison|Prison]].

He then spent much time travelling the world, often helping fellow travellers.

He soon accumulated a small following and began his ascension to godhood. In the common tongue many call him Dionysus, while in the elven tongue, he is often merely called The Traveller.

[[Tahlia Tormund]] owes the restoration of her sanity to him.

He took [[Jess Val|Lady Black]] as his apprentice in the year 5417 AA.
