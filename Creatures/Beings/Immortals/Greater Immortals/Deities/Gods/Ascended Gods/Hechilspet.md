Hechilspet was a king who ruled the Chish empire for some time. He was born of [[Iskandar|King Iskandar the Wise]] and [[Isa|Queen Isa]]. 

Izell died at childbirth, and his father, a noble man, helped unite the people of the region, and sacrified himself to save his realm, leaving the prince Hechilspet an orphan at twelve years old.

Hechilspet was never denied what he wished. He was very cunning, like his father, but unlike Iskandar he was self-serving.

He became a warlord, and expanded the empire to where it is known today. He took many items of great power from many people, including one of the Silanderi and even the Flameheart. 

He sought greatly the [[Tome of Silence]] of his father, but he could never find it.

He met Lysaria and was enamoured by her beauty, and lied to her that her lover had died in the nine hells, hoping to marry her. She refused, and he imprisoned her. She rejected him many more times before his escape.

Though he had his share of mistresses, he never married, and spoke only bitterly of Lysaria. She was the only one to ever defy him to his face before his defeat, and live to tell the tale. Of all the things he had ever demanded, she was the only one he could not get.

As his rule expanded, he became more ambitious and avaricious. He was widely considered a tyrant.

He struck down any who opposed him in single combat.

He knew all that occurred in his lands, and crime was nearly eradicated under his rule, and there were some who thought maybe times were better under this tyrant. 

As he got older, he began to fear death, and began searching for ways to prolong his life indefinitely. He sacrificed many slaves and siphoned their lives to increase in power, and began demanding worship of his people, until he ascended into godhood.

His acts of evil, though, did not decrease as time pass. He became more violent, impulsive, and mad. He needed greater punishments, more executions, more strange and unusual torture to satiate his bloodlust, and he became known as the god of bloodlust. Many feared him, and all called him mad.

[[Eleutheros]], an arch-fey of considerable prowess, managed to escape Hechilspet's great armies. 

Eventually Hechilspet decided to track him down personally, as he in his pride did not believe he could be defeated. It is not known how, but Eleutheros managed to lock him away in a [[Hechilspet's Prison|prison]] fit for a god, modeled after the nine hells. This was the year 3343.
