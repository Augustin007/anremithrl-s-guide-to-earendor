**Title: The Lady of Pain: Guardian and Enigma of Sigil**

---

**Introduction**
The Lady of Pain, an enigmatic figure shrouded in mystery, stands as one of the most compelling and formidable beings in the realm of Eärendor. An Elohim, the second highest rank among the gods, known as the warrior gods, she followed Thalorin and the Righteous Council during the tumultuous Sundered War. Her story is interwoven with sacrifice, power, and the inexorable link to the city she founded, Sigil.

**Creation and Role in the Eternal Wars**
Created by the primordial god Dur-bagaal during the height of the Eternal Wars, the Lady of Pain was forged as a weapon of divine retribution. As an Elohim, she was part of a cadre of celestial warriors designed to enforce the will of the higher gods and battle the chaotic forces that threatened the fabric of creation.

**The Sundered War and Sacrifice**
During the Sundered War, a conflict that scattered divine artifacts across the mortal realm, the Lady of Pain demonstrated her cunning and strategic prowess. In a pivotal moment, she trapped one of her formidable foes, Tartarus, within a gem now known as The Labyrinth Stone. This act, while a tactical victory, cost her dearly—sacrificing her divinity, sanity, and much of her power. The gem, driven to madness within its confines, was cast into the heart of a dense forest, sealing its malevolent occupant forever.

**Sigil: The City of Doors**
The aftermath of the war saw the Lady of Pain in a diminished state, choosing to live out her mortal existence on the material plane. It was during this period that she founded Sigil, a city unique in its placement at the nexus of the planes. Known as the City of Doors due to its myriad portals to other realms, Sigil became a hub of cosmic activity and intrigue under her watchful governance.

**Mysterious Guardian**
The Lady of Pain, while not a deity, possessed powers rivaling those of gods. She could block divine beings from entering Sigil and was capable of manipulating the city’s myriad portals. Her presence in Sigil was rarely seen but unmistakably felt. She hovered over the streets, her gaze alone capable of inflicting grievous wounds or causing individuals to vanish without a trace. Despite her immense power, she shunned worship and punished those who attempted to deify her, often with lethal consequences.

**The Dabus: Silent Servants**
Her will was carried out by the dabus, a race of creatures unique to Sigil. These beings, who never spoke, communicated through mystical images and word-pictures. They acted as both maintainers of the city’s infrastructure and enforcers of its ruler’s edicts.

**Connections and Legacy**
Rumored to have connections with other mysterious entities like the Raven Queen, the Lady of Pain was believed to understand many cosmic secrets and the true intentions of other enigmatic figures. Her creation of demiplanes and special prisons called "mazes" were just another aspect of her complex guardianship over Sigil.

**A Being of the City**
The Lady of Pain once expressed her bond with Sigil poetically, stating her inability to discern where she ended and the city began. Her senses were intertwined with the city's fabric, capturing every secret and witnessing every crime. Sigil was not just her domain; it was a part of her, and she, an integral part of it.

**Conclusion**
The Lady of Pain remains a pivotal figure in the lore of Eärendor, embodying the themes of power, sacrifice, and vigilance. Her story is a testament to the complexities of divine intervention and the burdens of eternal guardianship. As both protector and ruler, she ensures that Sigil remains a pivotal crossroads in the cosmic landscape, forever guarded by her unyielding presence.
