Cordast Tresant was a news reporter of [[Neros]] who reported on [[Selliso|Thorondor Selliso's]] doings. Cordast faked his death after several assassination attempts. In his effort to stay alive, he made a deal with [[Orthax]], and was bound to him for some time. 

In the end, Cordast managed to trick Orthax and steal enough of his power to attain a quasi-deity status. Now he lives in a [[Cordast's Home|demiplane of his own creation]].
