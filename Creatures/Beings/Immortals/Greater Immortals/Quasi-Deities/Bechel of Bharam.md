No one can truly say where Bechel is from. 

She is half-elven.

At some point, she allied herself with [[Asmodeus]].

In the summer of the year 4639 AA, she aids [[Tahlia Tormund]] take the throne of Karr. 

She tried to obtain the hand of [[Vecna]], but was met with the [[Dracholich of Karr]]. In the end he made an alliance with Bechel, giving her slaves and prisoners from his take, but would not suffer her to come near the hand. 

When Bechel betrayed Asmodeus in the winter of the next year, Tahlia chased after her into the nine hells, and Bechel captured her. 

Bechel kept her there sustaining her life by siphoning off Thalia's immortality, and protecting herself from the torture of the nine hells by stealing Asmodeus's protection over Thalia. This endured until Bechel was given the Sight by [[Marethyu]], 

After she left, she used the sight to make predictions and slowly formed a cult. They took over the kingdom of Crof and rename it [[Bharam]], and began to call themselves the [[Dreamers of Bharam]].

They are brutal and inhumane. They enslave, rape, and kill those who are not of the cult. The cult of Bharam think of themselves as being peacekeepers and protectors of mortals, but it is clear that they are not benevolent beings as they have been responsible for many atrocities throughout history. They are dangerous, powerful, and have existed for centuries under the leadership of the soothsayer Bechel. They have a great amount of foreknowledge of the future and have allied themselves with [[Tartarus]] and the [[Betrayer Gods]].

She obtained the [[Oathbow]] from the Dracholich, as well as the captured Lucy.

She fought against [[Marethyu]], [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Miyatol Dodonus]] after her enslavement of Lucy. They got away from her.

When the NAF reached out, she joined. Secretly, she was on the other side.

In the great meeting of the NAF, [[Bechel]] spoke to Aric, turning him against his allies, seeing them as enemies, and Aric swore himself to [[Tartarus]] and killed [[Bressus Stonefist]]. 

Bechel's treachery decimates the Northern Alliance's forces, a bitter blow that serves only to steel their resolve
