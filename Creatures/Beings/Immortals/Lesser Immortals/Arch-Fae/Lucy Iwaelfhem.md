Lucy was a dark faery and a Nyad, who lost her powers because of great crimes committed in the [[Feywild]], and was exiled to the [[Ephemeral Lands]]. Lucy was devoid of emotion to her mortal companions, but slowly warmed up to them, particularly [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], whom she would go on to marry. 

Lucy was a arch-fae allied with [[Sarnor]]

The Dark Fae fought and lost a battle with [[Eleutheros]], and she was stripped of her power and captured. [[Lady Elmenore]] ordered her executed but she escaped to the [[Ephemeral Lands]]. 

She was found by [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] alone in the woods. Slowly her power returned to her.

Together, they fought and killed [[Fildor]], the cleric of [[Shar]], who was causing abberations to grow in the woods.

She separated from Richard in this time, having enough magic to travel on her own, explored the area, temporarily getting stranded in [[Sholara]]. She commited various minor crimes, and was eventually captured by the [[Tyko]], a member of the [[Order of Pacis]], and after she mentioned she knew Richard, she was brought before [[Miyatol Dodonus]], who was now a prominent member of the order. She met and befriended [[Narnor Azerim|Lady Narnor]], who offered to take her to Richard so that he could vouch for her. Narnor spoke very highly of Richard. Lady Narnor is assasinated by the Greenclad before this can occur. She traveled with Miyatol to the Ordus Texerum and they are met by [[Tormac]], who secretly offers the Fae a return to her previous status and an alliance if she would betray Miyatol, she does this, but Richard finds and saves Miyatol, and she cannot bring herself to kill Richard, as she owed him her life. 

When Richard exposes Tormac, Lucy finds out Tormac killed [[Narnor Azerim]], and as she had promised to avenge her, she is conflicted. Her hesitation causes Tormac to attempt to kill her, and Richard saves her life and forgives her.

She fought off [[Tormac]], the previous head of the order, when Tormac allied himself with [[Tiamat]] and tried to free [[Hechilspet]] from his [[Hechilspet's Prison|Prison]], and subdued Hechilspet.

She was never a good friend of the King.

When Tormac returned as a chromatic dragon, she fought him off along with [[Baeor Dechaius]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Daedroy Belkar]].

She and Baeor fought and killed the Aboleth of Rymfel.

She did not fight in the battle of the Aetate Foedus, instead trying to flee the country.

Richard sent her a letter informing her of the deaths of [[Stoic Vanem]] and [[Baeor Dechaius]] and she vowed never to flee again, returning to Neros.

She fought the [[Dracolich of Karr]] alongside Daedroy, [[Miyatol Dodonus]], [[Tyko]], and Richard, but Daedroy and Tyko died, and the Richard and Miyatol were forced to flee, leaving Lucy behind to be captured, as she would not flee.

She was taken by the [[Dreamers of Bharam]] and eventually came before [[Bechel]], who took over her mind.

She was rescued by Richard and Miyatol a year later with the help of [[Marethyu]]

After this, she married Richard.

The three fought away the [[Beholders of Swanward]].

At Miyatol's urging, she went with him and killed [[Sarnor]] after this and restored the mirkwood to its previous state, undoing the last of the evil she had done.

When Sebastian did a difficult temporary resurection spell and recovered the soul of [[Baeor Dechaius]], Lucy dived into the [[The Labyrinth of Insanity]] with Richard to resurrect their friend, and created the [[Telos Construct]] that would bind his soul.

She tried and failed to resurrect Richard.

She locked herself up in a demiplane after Richard's death, only ever talking to Baeor.
