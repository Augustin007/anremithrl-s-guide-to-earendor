arnor was an arch-fae of great power, whose heart turned black with hatred. He caused great evil and made the [[Mirkwood]] a much more dangerous place, filling it with flora, fungi, and fauna of his own creation. He killed all he met, save those he tortured. He allied himself with [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] when she sought him out, attracted by his great power and evil. He found her desireable and had her join at his side. He stole all her feelings save her attraction for him. He manipulated her. Over time, Sarnor's heart turned black with hatred, and Lucy became the vessel for all of his evil desires. But he abandoned her when she was caught. Eventually Lucy shook off this curse, and returned to kill Sarnor.
