Artorius was [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]]'s older brother. The two of them studied under [[Rondar]]. 

Tal'berius and Artorius created the Codex Arcanum which included an introduction to logic, one hundred and twenty pages introducing alchemy and artifice, four hundred and forty five mathematical proofs, eighteen pages on categorisation of different magics, sources of magics, types of magic, and natures of it, arguing psionic talents were not of the same nature as magic, and a compilation of "Three hundred spells of usefulness for sorcerers learning to reign in their powers".
They created early calculation and mathematics spells with divination and introduced the concept of a limit point.
The god [[Vecna]] was split into pieces by [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]], [[Elu Singollo]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Elian]], [[The Raven Queen]], [[Vistani]], [[Artorius]], and Vecna's own leuitennant [[Kas]].  Each hid their piece in a different dungeon of their own creation, promising never to unify them.
Artorius died fighting [[Tharizdun]] alongside Tal'berius. His body was unmade, such that nothing remains of him.
