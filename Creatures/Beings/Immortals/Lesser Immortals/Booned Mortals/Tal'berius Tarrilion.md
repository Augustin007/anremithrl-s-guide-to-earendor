Tal'berius was born of Tar'Daroth'ul Magnar'illion, thiry years before the dundering war, and is known as Tar'illion. He was the son of [[Magnar]]. His brother, [[Artorius]] and he were both geniuses and powerful sorcerers, and were sent to study under [[Rondar]], and quickly outpaced Rondar's existing apprentice, [[Garrett]] until he quit. Twelve years before the Sundering War, he and his brother published the [[Codex Arcanum]].

The pair allied themselves with Singollo and fought on behalf of the mortals. 

The god [[Vecna]] was split into pieces by Tal'berius, Singollo, Glorfindiel, Elian, The Raven Queen, Vistani, Artorius, and Vecna's own leuitennant Kas.  Each hid their piece in a different dungeon of their own creation, promising never to unify them. Vistani died in this battle.

Artorius died fighting [[Tharizdun]], and Tal'berius in his anger, caused a cataclysmic rip in the weave that nearly destroyed the universe, which he was able to use to cut out the heart of the god and chain it down. This rip allowed pure Chaos through, which Tal'berius contained in the [[Orb of Annihilation]]. It also caused the destruction of the entire region, which would soon be called the Shattered Teeth.

Tal'berius and [[Dallion]] became loose friends during this time.

 After Artorius's death, [[Fangrim]] and Tal'berius create the first constructs.

Tal'berius fought and drove away [[Korvus]] with the aid of [[Shyvana]], stealing from Shyvana certain artifacts which he would study, earning her anger. When she came, demanding them back, he gave them back, having understood everything there was to them, and created his own. She tried to kill him, afterwards, but he killed her instead.

Tal'berius also earned the enmity of [[Tiberon]] and [[Rowena]], hunting artifacts on his own to keep for himself.

Falledric steals the [[Orb of Annihilation]] from him, and Tal'berius is unable to recapture it.

He was hired as Architect Arcane by his nephew when the city of Westhaven was founded as a sanctuary during the Sundered War.

He devotes his life to study and during the age of shadows creates walls powerful enough to keep even the gods out. He builds his lair in Illion's old lair, right at the intersection of Ley Lines, which he studies intensly.

He grows tired of having to stop to eat and sleep and creates a caffeneited brew powerful enough to rid him of these concerns.

He discovers the method of cloning himself, and transmitting memories and such through them. Keeping his soul bound to one body unless it died, in which he could transmit it to the next. He would teach this to [[Theriad Keladri]]

He worked with [[Theriad Keladri]] for a long time in developing ideas of type theory and category theory. 

He designs early Taxblades.

[[Davros]] also works with Tal'berius to design the Taxblades

Tal'berius creates the Astral Leywrite as the Architect Arcane.

He binds the area against teleportation when Auril destroys Westhaven and steals everything of value, magical or physical of the area.

He tracks down [[Ashdilkir]] and with [[Miyatol Dodonus]]'s help is able to take care of most of her [[Den]]. He is driven away by his fomer friend [[Kas]]. 

He regains his Orb, bypassing the teleportation block, and trying to avoid the attention of more powerful magic users, by using the [[Echoes of Divinity]] ship and crew to get to Othron Ibrith, and kills Falledric.

He hires them again for dealing with Ashdilkir, but fails to obtain the stone, and one of his clones gets killed in this process, as well as two taxblades being destroyed.

He is at the tree of names and manages to cut off a branch using an epic dragon scale.

He uses it to power his Astral Leywrite. He also sacrifices his hand to the tree, to gain knowledge.

When he discovers the Chaos Crack, he attempts to rebind it as he did before, but Chaos is more powerful than it used to be. In the end, in desparation, he travels and obtains Vecna's hand, and replaces his old hand with it.
