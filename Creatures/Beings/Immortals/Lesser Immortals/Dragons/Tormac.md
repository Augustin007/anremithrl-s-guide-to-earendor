Tormac was an ambitious and cunning individual who rose through the ranks of the Ordus Texerum early in Neros's history. He was one of the founders of the Greenclad, a group of spies and assassins who he hired out to political allies, that way getting rid of enemies without doing anything himself, and getting paid by the nobles for the sourcing of an assassin, and by the assassins for the sourcing of a job.

Eventually he was discovered by [[Narnor Azerim]]. Though he had Narnor killed, he was too late.  When this information reached a member of the Order named [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], Tormac tried and failed to kill Richard and his friends. 

With his secret out, he fled the country with his wealth and became a leader of the Greenclad. He led the criminal organisation into great success. Soon he caught the attention of [[Tiamat]]. He used the greenclad to discover the location of [[Hechilspet]], and at Tiamat's bidding tried to free the warlord. He was stopped by [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], who had ascended to high-sorcerer in his wake.

He participated in the war in secret, via the greenclad. Tiamat's influence on him became visible as he began his transformation into a dragon.

He returned to Neros as a dragon, but was fought off.

He returned again to Neros a few centuries later, polymorphed as a human. He was eventually discovered and exiled again. 

Now he ruled the Greenclad in secret, owning also his own lordship in Rymfel.

He was eventually killed by Gallio.
