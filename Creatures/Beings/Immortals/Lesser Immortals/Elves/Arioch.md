Arioch was an early sorcerer before the sundering war. He was an intelligent and curious individual who had a great passion for understanding the world around him. His interest in alchemy stemmed from his desire to discover the secrets of nature and create new things using the elements. He was known as Arioch the Alchemist and made early strides in classifying elements and compounds, and their effects on the weave.

He was also known for his ability to create potions more potent than anyone else.

He eventually died to one of his own experience.

Arioch's legacy lives on today as his work in alchemy and magic continues to influence the world of [[EÃ¤rendor]], and some of his potion recipes still remain a mystery thousands of years later.
