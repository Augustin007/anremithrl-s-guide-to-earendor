Dallion was the son of [[Singollo]] and [[Elian]], and the elder brother of [[Lysiria]]. While he was very smart, he was never able to connect with the weave, and remains one of the few non-magical elves.

He is an excellent swordsman and a great shot with the bow.

[[Vindel]] took Dallion under his wing as a pupil.

Dallion is known as the first mathematician.

The word "Ahiarime" or variable was coined by Dallion. It was originally defined by Dallion as "I nao telco iyes nosse ana ahime" which translates approximately to "that which is of the nature that it be related to change. He used it to formalise the idea of 'unknowns' and what to do if there was more than one thing that was not known.

When [[Karik]] of Gondal expanded on his work, [[Dallion]] was quite pleased, and the two began a correspondence, developing early algebra.

He would go on to meet [[Elthon]], and approved of his ideas, and encouraged [[Selina]] down her route.
