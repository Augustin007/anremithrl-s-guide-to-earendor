Elena's early development as a healer can be traced back to her discovery of the idea of "lifeweaving" in Araushnee's notes. This concept is based on the belief that life itself is a form of energy and that by manipulating this energy through magical means, it is possible to heal or harm others. Elena quickly became fascinated with this idea and began experimenting with different spells and techniques in order to develop her skills further..

Over time, Elena began to develop a reputation for her ability to heal those who were considered beyond help by traditional medical practitioners. Her methods were often unconventional but highly effective, and she soon attracted a devoted following among those seeking alternative forms of treatment.

In addition to her healing abilities, Elena was also known for her keen intellect and natural curiosity. She was always eager to learn more about the world around her and spent many hours poring over books and studying new theories in an effort to expand her knowledge base.

Her works served as an early basis for modern [[Biomancy]].
