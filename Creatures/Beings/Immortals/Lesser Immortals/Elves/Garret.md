Garrett was an early inventor of magical gadgets, blending rudimentary engineering with enchantments. He studied first with [[Rondar]], but could not keep up, and later apprenticed himself to the brothers [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] and [[Artorius]], who he acknowledged as smarter than he, but too interested in the theoretical to do anything practical. Garrett's skills in magic were limited by his own humility, as he believed that his inventions should be based on practicality rather than flashy displays of power. His ingenuity was such that many of his creations were ahead of their time. Tal'berius and Artorius greatly respected him. Garrett's most famous invention was his unfinished clockwork robot known as the "Mechanical Man". Garrett killed himself before its completion, but the brothers found it and finished it, crediting Garrett with it's creation. Despite its primitive design, it was one of the few devices capable of performing complex tasks autonomously before the Sundering War.
