### Lore
Maegard Haelstrom was once a renowned mage slayer. Not content with mortal limitations, he sought immortality to continue his crusade against rogue spellcasters. He succeeded by binding his essence to an arcane monolith in a secret location. This grants him both immortality and power but limits his ability to leave the Material Plane due to the Tree of Names. Unlike Theriad, he does not have patrons; instead, he has followers trained in the art of mage-slaying. Over centuries, he has accumulated powerful artifacts and spells specifically designed to counter magic users. It's said he has a secret sanctuary where he keeps arcane tomes that have dangerous knowledge, kept out of the wrong hands. He often is in conflict with Theriad, as he views the massive magical library as a potential threat.
