Talor grew up quiet and reserved, known as a gentle giant even among his own people. He loved to swim and spend time walking on the Hreghalk lakeshore.

Talor was conscripted in 5412 AS to the defence of his country.  

He trained well and a year later began to fight. 

In 5413, right before a battle, he recieved report that his entire family had been killed in an attack at Hreghalk. His best friend died in the battle right thereafter. A week later, he witnessed the Dragon-King, Valthor Remshi, descend upon a field of a thousand allies and unmake them in heartbeats. He survived the retreat, but left the next day.

Realizing he was now a deserter, he knew he could be hunted. He skulked the tree-lines of border hamlets, stealing bread and salted meat from sheds, sleeping in coppices, listening for trackers. 

One day, he saw a small group of merchant travelers with tracking hounds. When they passed twice along the same lane, he concluded they were tracking him. He decided to ambush them, and killed the men and dogs alike, took their goods, and ran. 

Thereafter he could never stand dogs, as they reminded him of that moment. 

He fled for months, barely surviving a trek through the border of the Sholaran desert, nearly dying of thirst and hunger. As he lay dying, he encountered [[Huldan]], a hermit who lived in the wilds. Deciding he couldn't be trusted alongside people, he decided to take after Huldan and learned from him how to survive. Eventually he parted ways with Huldan and set up his own home in the Golin forests. Despite himself, he continued to train his strength and keep his military exercises and training.

When Auril's blizzards ravaged Foedus in the Summer of 5421, Talor was caught unprepared for the sudden shift from sunlight. Lost in the storm, he was forced to take shelter in a cave. The cave would turn out to belong to a necromancer, whose creations were assailing [[Thalai Elanthino]] and [[Naras Vorasthar]] and was able to save Naras's life.

The two met [[Torquil Leogan|Ahktos Nestore]] whilst attempting to find shelter. When Ahktos lied to them, they forced him to make an unbreakable oath not to lie to them.

[[The Earthquake]] destroyed Talor's home.
