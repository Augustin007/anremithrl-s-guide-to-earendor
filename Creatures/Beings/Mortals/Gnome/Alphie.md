Alphie was among the gnomes who woke in then-Trixail. He was the third to wake up, after [[Colossus]] and Norvias. 

He was ambitious and power hungry, and used Colossus as a puppet to rule the Gnomes, and encouraged the killing of humans. When Colossus proved a aware of what was occurring, to be against it, and to have too strong of a loyalty among the gnomes, Alphie staged a coup-de-etat to try to kill him. This led to the first kin-slaying among the Chiefly-Gnomes of the forest. While Colossus got away, most of his following was slain. When the Arithmorei came to investigate what had occurred, Alphie fled with his people to the north with promises of power and swore his allegiance to [[Auril]], leaving six men behind to track down the fleeing Colossus.

He was attacked along the way by [[Colossus]] and his [[Echoes of Divinity|new allies]], but he successfully drove them away.

He became one of the [[Sons of Auril]], an order of warlocks devoted to Auril, gaining much power from her. 

He participated in the destruction of Westhaven.

He was killed in the taking of Aldarkeep Pass by [[Galio Thunukalathi]].
