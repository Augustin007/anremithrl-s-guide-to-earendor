King Colossus of Gnomes'hell, a gnome who had been turned to stone and awakened alongside many other gnomes with no memories. He became the king of these gnomes for some time. He was a wizard with a formidable mind and photographic memory. During this time, he heard a voice in his head, this was the voice of the The Raven Queen, advising him. He was a weak king, and did not want to take the lead, instead allowing his advisor, Alphie, to do as he wished. When she warned him his advisor, Alphie, was evil. He did not listen to this voice, not trusting its source. But Alphie gave himself up to Auril in exchange for power to shatter his kingdom and take power, and now his people are currently scattered and many no longer see him as king, seeing instead Alphie as their lord. 

He devotes himself to restoring unity in his kingdom and recovering the lost memories of the gnomes, but he cannot inspire his people to unite. He is approached by Nugget, who wants help tearing down Auril, and the voice tells him to accept. This time he listens. When Auril tore down Westhaven, he saw a repeat of what occurred to his own kingdom and demanded the help of the voice. The Raven Queen channeled her divinity through him, and he used her power to save as many people as he could with the help of Nugget, including King Idros of Westhaven. 

He met Dirk the Goliath before his death at Bremen.

He spoke against the murder of Kalquend.

The Raven Queen then spoke to him and told him to meet her personally in the fortress of memories, the Raven Queen’s home. During this time, Nugget was incapacitated by Asmodeus, and Colossus is left in command of the party. He barely kept them together, afraid to take command, but in the end he directed them towards the Raven Queen. There Colossus was given spells for the binding of a god to use against Auril, though he is not powerful enough to cast it on his own, and as it is arcane and not divine magic, the Raven Queen can no longer cast it, or help him cast it. He would need to lead a large group in order to cast it. He made a deal with Asmodeus to return Nugget, both out of loyalty to his friend, but also out of fear of leadership, allowing Nugget to return to lead the party. He discovered Nugget’s brutal murdering of several dwarves from behind the party’s back, angering him.

Ashdilkir trapped him in an echo plane, and stole his spell book, it was from here Asmodeus was able to discover by which spells the Raven Queen defeated his brother, but Colossus escaped the plane with the help of Tal'berius. 

He confronted Nugget, but Asmodeus took him over and used him to try and steal the name of his brother from Nugget, calling in the favour. Nugget had his friends kill him to prevent the end of the world at Colossus's hands.

When Nugget perished, a heavy weight settled on Colossus' shoulders. The loss of his friend and the disarray that followed served as a stark reminder of the responsibilities he had long neglected. With a newfound resolve, Colossus returned to Gnomes'hell, the fractured gnome community he once led. 

Accompanied by four rescued gnomes from Westhaven, he found the remnants of his people—eighteen souls clinging to the hope of a better future. Under Colossus' reign, they buried their dead and began the arduous process of rebuilding. The community grew as scattered gnomes returned to their homeland, and by the end of the second year, the population had swelled to around 600.

During this time, Colossus took it upon himself to pen the history of his people and their trials, including the stories of Nugget and Alphie. His works, "A Brief Gnomish Account of the Age Arcana" and a foundational text on gnomish language and culture, became cornerstones for the community's identity.

Agriculture flourished with the cultivation of garlic and acorns, and a feudal system was established to manage land and resources. Timber became a modest export, and the economy began to stabilize. Sociopolitical groups emerged, debating issues from human citizenship to educational reform. A small religious order dedicated to the Raven Queen was established, led by two Warlocks who served as chief doctors and seven Paladins.

But as the third year drew to a close, the shadow of Auril began to creep over Gnomes'hell. The summer was unusually cold, and the winter that followed was harsher still. When spring and summer returned, the warmth did not. Then the first of Auril's snowfalls struck, plunging Gnomes'hell into a new era of uncertainty and peril.

Just when it seemed that the community would be consumed by this dark turn of events, a call to adventure resounded in Colossus' soul. The Raven Queen's voice whispered in his ear, urging him to gather his strength and prepare for a new quest. The time had come to leave Gnomes'hell once more, to face the looming threat and perhaps find a way to dispel the icy grip of Auril that now threatened not just his home, but the entire world.

Sometimes called the mage King.
