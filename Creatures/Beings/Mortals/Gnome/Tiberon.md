Tiberon was an apothecary and alchemist who greatly advanced chemical and alchemical understandings during the Sundered War. He worked alongside [[Rowena]], another alchemist, to recover, reverse engineer, and repurpose divine artifacts for use in mortal warfare. Their efforts significantly shifted the balance of many encounters, and their work is still highly regarded among scholars and historians today. Tiberon's legacy lives on through his works and discoveries, which continue to be studied and applied by alchemists. He was an adversary of [[Tal'berius]].
