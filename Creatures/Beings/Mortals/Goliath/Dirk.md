Dirk the Goliath

Dirk was a Goliath born in the city of [[Bremen]]. He was bitten by a werebear in his youth. Because of this, he had a difficult childhood, growing up as an outcast.

He met [[Colossus]], [[PINE-APL]], and [[Padfoot]] as they were travelling south east from [[Bremen]] towards the [[Trees of Sanctuary|Tree of Names]].

 Dirk was accused of setting a bomb that killed a family of four. This was actually done by [[Jess Val|Lady Black]] and [[Nugget Remshi]]. He was tried for this crime and executed.
