Gauthak Thunukalathi the Dawncaller - The ghost of his Great Great Grandfather- Galio looks up to him, Gauthak critisizes everything he does. Gauthak was famous for being the sole survivor of a great battle, and he described the battle as being much worse than it was, he fled the battle, that is why he survived, though he lies and says he fought. Gauthak is all talk, no actual experience.
