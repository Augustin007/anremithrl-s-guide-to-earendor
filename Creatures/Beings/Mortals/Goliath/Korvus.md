Korvus the Deathcaller is a powerful necromancer who sought to create an army of undead to serve his master, the dread lord [[Tharizdun]].

He also sought out powerful artifacts, which would aid him in his quest. One such artifact was [[Shyvana]]'s Staff. Korvus stole it from her and used it as a focus to create an even more powerful undead army than before.

However, his thirst for power soon brought him into conflict with Shyvana herself. She had come to reclaim the artifact, and he refused to give it back. This led to a bloody battle between the two, but in the end, he was able to drive her away.

She returned, having sought the alliance of [[Tal'berius]], and the two were able to disperse his armies and kill him.
