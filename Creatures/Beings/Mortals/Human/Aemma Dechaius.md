Aemma carries herself with the confidence and demeanor of someone raised among nobility, something she can't quite hide no matter how hard she tries.

She is tall and lean, built for speed. Her hair is cut short. Her skin is lightly freckled.

She's constantly pushing against authorities, as if pushing to see how far she can push before retaliation.

She wears cheap travel-worn leather armor, light and flexible, made for movement rather than defense. A fine rapier rests at her hip—an heirloom, the one piece of her noble past she refuses to part with. 

Aemma is quick-witted, sarcastic, and fiercely independent, but she masks her deeper emotions beneath layers of deflection and humor. She is quick to run from responsibility, but she also refuses to be dismissed.

Aemma was born into a name that once shook the world. The House of Dechaius was once among the greatest military families in Neros, tracing their lineage back nearly a thousand years to Baeor Dechaius, one of the most famous generals in history.

After King Klaethor II's death, Thorondor's rebellion, and the institution of the council, the Dechaius family had lost much of their wealth, lands, and noble titles. 

Tradition persisted where power did not.
The men of the family trained as warriors and soldiers, sent into the Neroshi military the moment they were old enough to weild a sword, married off as soon as they returned. The women were taught to manage households, to marry well. All were taught diplomacy, and to secure what political influence they could. 

Aemma hated it. She refused to learn. At eight years old she fled her family, taking only the rapier given to her by her older brother before he left to the army.

Aemma excelled in combat training, especially in dueling and swordplay, but she struggled with academic discipline. She was brilliant, but reckless—clever, but lacked patience. She got into fights with instructors, defied rules, and never quite learned how to keep her mouth shut.

She made enemies among the faculty and friends among troublemakers.

By the time she was fifteen, Aemma had dropped out.

She told herself it was by choice—that she was never meant to sit in classrooms, that she would find her own way, without rules and without expectations.

But the truth was harsher—she failed out because she refused to play the game.

Without a degree, without guild sponsorship, and without her family to fall back on, Aemma found herself stuck. 

Despising the guild's bureaucracy, she managed to do the bare minimum to get quest markers. She completed both quests, minor unranked quests. If caught as unproctored, she could lose her guild permit and be expelled.
