King Hrothgar Arden was the first king of [[Swanward]], and he was named such due to his victory over the aberrations that plagued the land. He was a strong and determined leader who led the tribes of Swanward in uniting against their common enemy.

Born into a warrior tribe from what is now known as Swanward, Hrothgar Arden was well-trained in fighting and strategy. His mother was killed by one of the many aberrations that plagued the land in that time. He rose up to lead in the fight of mortals against these creatures. After several successful battles, he united the tribes and named himself King of Swanward, with the goal of driving away all aberrant beings from the land.

Though his rule was mostly supported, as he only asked for help in driving away the aberrations and for peace between the tribes, not all accepted him. The [[Beholders of Swanward]] were summoned by the Illithid warlock [[Nadek]] to challenge his rule.

In addition to his military prowess, King Hrothgar Arden was also known for his kindness and compassion towards those around him.
