Kerran was an asthmatic four‑year‑old from Azerim. His mother died giving birth to him; his father worked as a city clerk. His brother Naren—twelve years older and a newsboy—often carried baby Kerran while selling papers, playing on pity to make sales.

When the dragon struck Azerim, the crowd pressed against Naras’s forming ward. Naren could not force his way in. He thrust Kerran into his friend, Aric Vael’s, arms before the barrier sealed. Aric kept the child close thereafter.

Through the continued journey, Kerran drifted in and out of consciousness, lungs raw from cold and debris. Torquil’s alchemy blunted the worst of the fumes after the dragon Tormac’s first pass in Azerim; Serin Rathir, silent and watchful, sat with him during fevers and night terrors.

He improved to some extent at Bremen, becoming less lethargic and more clingy to Aric, Lirien, Serin, and Talor, but did not get along much with Liriel, starting to fit into his new family. He did not seem to understand what was happening.

During the canary trials in the descent toward the Underdark, Kerran was found awakened and well, as if the ordeal had lifted some weight from him. He rejoined Aric and Lirien with shy smiles and short, careful breaths.

In the Underdark, he was exposed to some spores, which slowly began to kill him.

#### **Backstory**

Kerran was the youngest child in a small, loving family in Bremen. His mother died giving birth to him. His oldest brother ran a newspaper, and his father worked as a clerk in the town hall. Life was simple but happy.

When the dragon attacked, Kerran’s world was shattered. He was separated from his parents and siblings in the chaos and witnessed their deaths from the dragon's poison. He passed out from the fumes. He was saved by a boy who picked him up and carried him into the Wind Ward, unbeknownst to him, this boy was Aric.

Since that day, Kerran has been plagued by the lingering effects of the poison, leaving him physically weak and prone to illness. He has become deeply attached to the other children and the party members who saved him, relying on them for protection and comfort as they journey through the dangerous world that has become his new reality.

- **Aric Vael:**  
  - Kerran looks up to Aric as a protector and older brother figure. He often clings to him, feeling safe when Aric is near.

- **Lirien Vael:**  
  - Kerran sees Lirien as a playmate and fellow child, though he also looks up to him as a slightly older “big brother.” He admires Lirien’s bravery and tries to follow his lead, though his fear sometimes holds him back.

  - He likes it when she reads or talks to him, even if he doesn’t understand everything she says. 

- **Naras:**
