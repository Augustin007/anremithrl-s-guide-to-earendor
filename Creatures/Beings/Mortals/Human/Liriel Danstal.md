#### **Physical Appearance**

Liriel is a 13-year-old girl who stands at 4’10”, noticeably shorter than her peers. She is slender and delicate, with a frame that suggests she spends more time in intellectual pursuits than physical activities. Despite this, her agility and quick reflexes indicate she has learned to navigate tricky environments.

Her chestnut-brown hair is just long enough to be tied back in a ponytail, though it always seems to escape in wisps. Liriel’s most striking feature is her intelligent brown eyes, which are always bright with curiosity and often darting around as she takes in her surroundings. Her eyes reveal her quick mind and eagerness to learn, but they also hide the emotions she bottles up.

Liriel’s skin is fair, with a few freckles on her cheeks and nose. She has small, nimble hands, marked by minor cuts and ink stains from her work with calligraphy and alchemy. Her skin is naturally more pale, so the dragon-poison blotches show up much more noticeably. She was dressed in neat, well-fitted, new-ish button shirt and skirt, with pants underneath the skirt. Though now her clothing is a little torn and stained, she takes care to keep her appearance neat.

#### **Personality**

She’s also open to learning from others, understanding that she doesn’t have all the answers. Liriel is quick-thinking and resourceful, often coming up with creative solutions to problems. She’s not one to panic in difficult situations, instead focusing on analyzing the situation and finding a way through it.

- **Chatty:** Liriel is talkative, often sharing her thoughts and observations without a second thought. Her quick mind and curiosity drive her to speak first and think later, which sometimes gets her into trouble. She constantly talks under her breath to herself without even noticing. Impeding her stealth.
- **Impatient:** Liriel gets frustrated when others, particularly adults, can’t keep up with her in academic or intellectual pursuits. She learns quickly and sometimes forgets that others may need more time to grasp concepts that come easily to her.
- **Impulsive:** Liriel tends to leap into action, driven by her enthusiasm and desire to help, sometimes before fully considering the consequences. While Liriel values the group’s safety, she’s not afraid to go off on her own if she believes it’s necessary. This independence can sometimes lead to friction, especially when her decisions seem risky to others.

This desire to keep the peace can sometimes lead her to avoid necessary confrontations or difficult decisions.

#### **Backstory**

Liriel grew up in Bremen, the daughter of scholars who valued knowledge and learning above all else. She was a prodigy, quickly mastering reading, writing, and languages, and her parents nurtured her talents with access to books and ancient texts. Liriel often accompanied her parents on their research trips, where she developed a love for languages and history.

The dragon’s attack on Bremen shattered Liriel’s world, taking her parents and the life she knew. Though she survived, the trauma of the event left deep scars. She was found by Naras, Talor, and Torquil, who took her in. Liriel threw herself into her studies as a way to cope, determined to use her knowledge to protect the others and ensure they didn’t suffer the same fate as her parents.

Liriel’s initial bond with Torquil, forged through their shared interest in alchemy, was broken when she discovered his betrayal. Though she has kept this knowledge to herself, it weighs heavily on her, fueling a hatred she struggles to hide.

Despite her struggles, Liriel remains a key member of the group, using her intelligence and resourcefulness to help them navigate their dangerous new reality. She sees Aric as a stabilizing force and supports him as much as she can, though her crush on him adds a layer of complexity to their relationship.

#### **Relationships with the Others**

- **Aric Vael:**  
  - Liriel respects Aric’s leadership and feels a strong sense of camaraderie with him, given their shared responsibility for the younger children. She sees him as a stabilizing force and often supports his decisions, though she’s not afraid to offer her own perspective.
  - Liriel might act as a sounding board for Aric, discussing strategies or plans with him before they act. She is attracted to his protective nature and might try to lighten his burden by taking on some of the intellectual or diplomatic challenges the group faces. They likely share a mutual respect and understanding, even if they don’t always agree.
  - She is oblivious to his slight feelings towards her, believing he couldn't possibly like her.
  - Liriel has a crush on Aric, which she tries to hide.  

- **Kerran:**  
  - Liriel views Kerran as someone who needs protection and care, but she also sees potential in him. She’s aware of his vulnerability due to his young age and tries to provide comfort and security whenever possible.
  - She very much likes to take care of Kerran.
  - She feels a maternal instinct towards him, though she knows she’s too young to be a mother figure. Liriel tries to protect Kerran from the harsh realities of their situation, using her knowledge to keep him safe.

- **Lirien Vael:**  
  - Liriel finds Lirien’s jealousy towards her relationship with Aric both frustrating and endearing. She tries to be patient with him, understanding that he’s still very young and has been through a lot. Liriel often tries to include Lirien in their plans, hoping to earn his trust.

- **Naras:**  
  - Liriel respects Naras's leadership and his higher-class habits. She respects his intellegence but still gets impatient because he's an adult but he doesn't always see what she sees. 

- **Serin:**  
  - Liriel doesn't really _get_ Serin. She figured out way before the rest that Serin was a Peredhel, and is aware that she's fragile and traumatised, but doesn't know much beyond that. Serin doesn't talk much, so Liriel doesn't pay her much mind. 
  - She doesn't like Serin when Aric tries to get Serin to open up, but afterwards feels silly. She isn't sure what the feeling is.

- **Talor:**  
  - Liriel is intrigued by Talor. She respects his strength and is grateful for his protection, but she doesn’t fully understand him. Liriel tries to learn more about Talor’s background and culture, seeing it as a way to build trust between them, but Talor hardly speaks.

- **Torquil:**  
  - Liriel once looked up to Torquil and was close to him, learning alchemy from him. However, after discovering his betrayal, she now harbors a deep hatred for him. Though she hasn’t told the group about this, it colors all her interactions with him. She is careful around him, keeping her distance.
