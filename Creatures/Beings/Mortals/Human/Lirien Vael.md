#### **Physical Appearance**
Lirien is a small, wiry six-year-old with a thin, almost delicate build. He stands at about 3'6" and is light for his age, with limbs that seem just a bit too long for his body, indicating a recent growth spurt.

His hair is a messy tangle of dark brown, often falling into his bright blue eyes, which are wide but now more guarded, reflecting the loss of his former curiosity and playfulness. His face still retains a hint of babyish roundness, but his gaze is more intense and serious, a sign of the trauma he’s endured.

Lirien’s skin is pale but has a slightly ruddy tint from time spent outdoors, marked by small scrapes and bruises. He moves with a quiet, almost hesitant energy, rarely still but not as boisterous as one might expect from a child his age.

His clothing is practical, a bit too big, and often dirty from his explorations. He wears a pair of worn boots that used to belong to his brother, slightly too large for his feet but tied tightly to avoid tripping. 
#### **Personality**
- **Dependent:** Lirien’s deepest flaw is his overwhelming dependence on his older brother, Aric. Since the dragon’s attack, he has become even more attached to Aric, rarely leaving his side and constantly seeking his reassurance.
- **Jealous:** Lirien feels a strong sense of jealousy over Aric's attention. He often acts up or interrupts conversations when he's feeling left out or worried that he’s losing his brother’s attention.
- **Impatient:** Lirien struggles with patience, often wanting immediate answers or results. This impatience can lead to frustration, especially when things don’t go his way or when he feels ignored.
- **Loyal:** Despite his flaws, Lirien is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, especially Aric. He looks up to his brother as his protector and role model, trying to emulate him in any way he can, even if it’s not always successful.
- **Not Resilient:** Unlike some of the other children, Lirien isn’t particularly resilient. He is still struggling to cope with the trauma he has experienced, and this often manifests as clinginess or fearfulness, especially when he’s separated from Aric.

#### **Backstory**
Lirien was born in the city of Bremen, where he lived with his older brother Aric and their parents. He had a happy, if simple, childhood, spending his days helping his parents in their apothecary and playing with other children in the city.

When the dragon attacked, Lirien witnessed the devastation firsthand. Though Aric covered his eyes, he was a second to late. Lirien saw the people he loved most in the world perish from the dragon’s poison, an experience that haunts him despite his attempts to stay cheerful. Since the destruction of Bremen, Lirien has relied on Aric for safety and guidance, trying his best to be strong for his brother and the other children they’ve met.

Lirien’s world has shrunk to revolve around Aric, and he struggles with feelings of jealousy and fear whenever Aric’s attention is elsewhere. He looks up to Naras because Aric does, but his primary focus is always on staying close to his brother. His bond with Serin is slowly growing, as he recognizes in her a similar loss and need for understanding.


#### **Relationships with the Others** (From closest to farthest)
- **Aric Vael (Older Brother):**

  - Feels completely lost without his brother.

- **Serin:**
  - Lirien feels a kinship with Serin, intrigued by her quiet nature. He doesn’t fully understand her, but he senses that they share a similar pain. He’s drawn to her in a way that he can’t quite explain, and he often seeks her out when he’s feeling particularly lost or lonely.
  - He sees Serin as a good friend, even though they don't talk to each other.

- **Kerran:**
  - Lirien sees Kerran as someone he needs to protect, despite being young himself. He feels a sense of responsibility toward Kerran, trying to keep him entertained or comforted, especially when things get scary. But sometimes he gets jealous of when his brother comforts Kerran. 
  - He wants to be Kerran's older brother.

- **Naras:**
  - Lirien looks up to Naras because Aric does, though his admiration is secondary to his bond with his brother. He tries to impress Naras in small ways, hoping to gain his approval, but he’s always more concerned with how Aric views him.

- **Liriel Danstal:**
  - Lirien feels a sense of jealousy toward Liriel, particularly when she and Aric are close. He sometimes acts out or interrupts their conversations, feeling threatened by their bond. However, he also respects her intelligence, even if he’s not fully comfortable with her yet.

- **Talor:**
  - Lirien is both fascinated and a little scared of Talor. He’s curious about the bugbear but is also hesitant to approach him, often watching him from a distance rather than interacting directly.

- **Torquil:**
  - Lirien is unsure about Torquil, picking up on the caution others feel around him. He’s curious but also wary, sensing that there’s more to Torquil than meets the eye. He keeps his distance, preferring to observe rather than engage.
