Miyatol studied at Strixhaven alongside [[Daedroy Belkar]], [[Stoic Vanem]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Narnor Azerim]]. He never participated in the shenanigans of his friends at the university and eventually dedicated himself to the oath of the [[Order of Pacis]], where he met [[Tyko]]. He was quite surprised when he met [[Narnor Azerim]], who had ascended to Lady of [[Azerim]], and asked about Richard. He encouraged her to keep up a correspondence with him.

Tyko brought [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] before him when she claimed she knew Richard. He made sure to pass this information to his friend Lady Narnor, who was the lady of the region.

After Narnor's assasination, he aided Lucy in her travels to Oracus, trying to find out more about the death and being told Richard knew more. They were pursued by mysterious green rogues.

He was betrayed by Lucy and rescued by Richard.

He was the one who told Richard of Narnor's death.

He persuaded Richard to forgive Lucy.

His order called him to the front lines of the War of Wrath, and he could not aid Richard in fighting Tormac.

He called on Richard for help about a criminal he caught doing strange magics, and was present for the great escape from [[Dol Garoth Prison]]. He was taken hostage.

He was dragged into the underdark and found out about the dealings of the [[Dracolich of Karr]]. He escaped his captors, but was recaptured when he chose to save their lives from brutal death from a Naga.

He was rescued by Richard and Daedroy soon thereafter.

He fought in the battle of the Aetate Foedus, where his friends [[Stoic Vanem]] and [[Baeor Dechaius]] were slain.

He recruited [[Tyko]], Daedroy, Richard, and Lucy to fight the [[Dracolich of Karr]], but the battle was disastrous and resulted in the deaths of Tyko and Daedroy, and Lucy was captured. He and Richard fled.

They rescued Lucy from [[Bechel]] a year, getting the help of [[Marethyu]].

Miyatol went north to continue his work in the order, helping the people of the region. He died in Bremen, killed by [[Ashdilkir]].
