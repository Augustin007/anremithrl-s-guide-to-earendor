Narnor was the daughter of Lord Nerach Azerim. 

Narnor went to school alongside [[Stoic Vanem]], [[Daedroy Belkar]], [[Miyatol Dodonus]], and [[Richard Iwaelfhem]]. Being rich, she often got in trouble expecting her father to bail her out, but almost got herself and her friends expelled. She rather liked Richard, and would have gone with him to Aleras, but her father died mysteriously, and she took up Ladyship of [[Azerim]]. She kept a corresondance with Richard, though. She spent some time trying to uncover the mystery of her father's death, collecting some evidence of the Greenclad, but nothing concrete. At Miyatol's insistance, she allowed the [[Order of Pacis]] to set up an outpost in her land, and she was glad to see Miyatol again, who encouraged her correspondance with Richard.

When [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] was brought to her, for crimes, she was a bit jealous, but she quickly ended up befriending Lucy, and figuring out that Richard was tangled in the Greenclad as well. She gathered her evidence and planned to escort Lucy to Richard. 

She was assasinated by Tormac.

Her younger sister was Liriath, who married the Duke of [[Vasterra]].
