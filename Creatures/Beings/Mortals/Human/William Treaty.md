Sir Treaty, a veteran ex-ranger from Araluen turned bounty hunter travelling alongside the party. Sir Treaty was a hero and spy in the great war of the Aetate Foedus. After his wife, the only person left he cared about, was killed in a fire. He left the Ranger Corps and hunted down the arsonist responsible for the fire. He was exiled for murdering the man without a trial. He became a bounty-hunter in Neros. During this time he took on a bounty for Lady Jessica Black, who he chased all the way to the Frozen North, but joined the party when Nugget offered him a chance at a greater prize, offering him a vast amount of gold from his fatherâ€™s coffers if he were to help stop Auril. He has been travelling with the party for over a year with this goal. Because he is so consumed by greed, he has called the attention of Tiamat, the goddess of greed. He has a dragon-spirit, and Tiamat wishes to awaken it, turning him into a dragon. He has recently taken a dagger that once belonged to Tiamat herself during the Sundering War. He can hear her talking to him in her head, but does not know who she is.

He refuses her advances in the end. And begins his shipping company shortly after aiding Lady Black in killing Nugget.
