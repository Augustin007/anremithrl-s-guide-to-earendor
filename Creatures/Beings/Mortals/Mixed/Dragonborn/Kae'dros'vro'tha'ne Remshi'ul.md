Crown Prince for over a century; slain in Khazadum winter war. He only had daughters. His line would go on to become the Rashauri family.

Here’s a full draft for Kae’dros’vro’tha’ne Remshi’ul based on your lore, tying him into both the Remshi dynasty and later events like Xyrdakul’s independence:

---

**Birth Year:** 4642 AS
**Death Year:** 4771 AS (Khazadum Winter War)

### Early Life & Heirship

Born during the height of the Age of Harmony’s expansionist peace in Northern Foedus, Kae’dros was the firstborn son of Valthor Remshi and Maraveth Kalagiano, and from his earliest years was groomed to inherit the Dragon Throne. His Solenthiri mother drilled him in diplomacy and law, while his father and the draconic lords forged him into a warrior-scholar.

The boy’s upbringing was a careful blend of courtly elegance and martial rigor. From the age of nine, he trained in the use of the great glaive—the traditional weapon of Drakenthorne’s crown princes—and at twelve he rode with the Dragon Host in ceremonial campaigns along the northern marches. Kae’dros’ tutors noted his sharp strategic mind but also his unyielding pride; he carried himself as though the throne were not merely his right by birth, but by merit.

### Military Career

By the time he came of age, Kae’dros had earned the loyalty of the border legions. Appointed **Warden of the Northern Marches**, he oversaw the fortresses along the Drakenthorne–Khazadum frontier, where dwarven tensions simmered despite formal truces. Kae’dros favored a doctrine of aggressive readiness—stockpiling arms, drilling soldiers in winter campaigns, and commissioning watchtowers deep in the high passes.

His leadership during the brief **Siege of Stormhold** (4734 AS) won him fame; with only 800 men he held the fortress against a force triple his number until reinforcements arrived. Ballads from the era speak of the Crown Prince personally leading midnight sallies through blizzard and darkness, his glaive gleaming with dragonfire.

### Marriage & Issue

Kae’dros married Lady Velistra Morvain of House Morvain—a union designed to bind one of Drakenthorne’s most influential noble houses to the crown. Their marriage was politically successful but personally distant. Velistra bore him **seven daughters** over the next four decades:

1. **Princess Aerivra** – Married into House Rhasauri; matriarch of its later power.
2. **Princess Thavessra** – Died young of a wasting fever.
3. **Princess Calynne** – Scholar and court historian; her writings survive in the Archives of Xyrdakul.
4. **Princess Morvanna** – Married Lord Protector of the Eastern March.
5. **Princess Velissra** – Entered the priesthood of the Ring of Flame.
6. **Princess Zhaedryn** – Married into a Khazadum noble line, cementing a rare peace period.
7. **Princess Aranthyl** – The youngest; later grandmother to the Lord of Xyrdakul during its rebellion.

Because Kae’dros had no sons, political debate over succession simmered constantly at court. This absence of a direct male heir would one day help fracture Drakenthorne’s unity.

### The Khazadum Winter War

In 4771 AS, escalating disputes over mining rights in the frost-veins of the North erupted into the **Khazadum Winter War**. Kae’dros, honoring the ancient oaths of the Dragon Host, led a campaign into the high passes to break the dwarven advance before they could seize Aldrath’s Gate.

The campaign was brutal—fought in the deep cold of a sunless winter. Dwarves fortified every approach with fire-lances and collapsing tunnels, while blizzards cut off supply lines. After months of attrition, the decisive battle came at the **Pass of Gravenhalm**. Leading the vanguard, Kae’dros fought deep into the dwarven shield-walls, slaying the Khazadum warlord in single combat—but was mortally wounded in the melee.

He died before his bannermen could carry him from the field. His body was returned to Drakenthorne beneath a banner of ice and flame, and entombed in the Hall of Scales beside the Dragonking’s own throne.

### Legacy

Kae’dros’ death marked a turning point in Drakenthorne’s fortunes. His daughters’ marriages had woven a complex web of alliances, but also rival claims to the throne. The most enduring legacy of his line came through **Princess Aranthyl’s descendants**, who centuries later would lead Xyrdakul in its rebellion against Drakenthorne, citing the Crown Prince’s blood as their rightful sovereignty.

The noble house that arose from his line—**House Rashauri**—became one of the most storied in the realm, known for its martial tradition and its uneasy relationship with the Dragon Throne. To this day, the Rashauri keep Kae’dros’ glaive in their great hall, its blade still faintly warm with the dragonfire of the last Crown Prince who never ruled.
