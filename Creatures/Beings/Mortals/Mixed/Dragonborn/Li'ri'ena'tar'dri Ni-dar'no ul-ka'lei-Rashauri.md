Lady Lirien Rashauri (Li'ri'ena'tar'dri Ni-dar'no ul-Rashauri; born: Li Dar'no) was born into the great war between the dragonborn and the dwarves. Her family was of note, and taught her much of politics, and planned to marry her off to the king [[Ar'ric'tar Gri-Vyrshaen]]. She managed to escape this fate after much pleading. Eventually she fell in love with the general [[Dri'zte ka'lei-Rashauri]], who was a kind and good man, and trusted by his soldiers. 

They eloped and married against the wishes of either family.

Lord Drizzt wished for peace in the war, as did she, and they devoted much effort to it.

The area of Dineval had been promised to Drizzt and Lirien after they took the region in the war. 

The two did a lot of work in securing the truce. 

Ar'ric eventually tried to take the land of Dineval when they found great wealth in it, arguing he had never formally given it to them, only promised. Drizzt and Lirien raised a small rebellion and now consider themselves their own country of [[Cair-Dineval]], though house Vyrshaen still considers the land theirs, and does not respect their independence. Sections of house Rashauri eschew their claim, including the matriarch lady [[Aill'ena Rashauri]]

She attended the great meeting of the NAF as the representative of Cair-Dineval, much to Aric's anger. Bechel spoke to Lirien, telling her what to say to further enrage Aric. Her husband sacrificed her life so she could escape the great meeting.
