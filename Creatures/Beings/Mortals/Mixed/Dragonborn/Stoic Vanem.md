Stoic was an Velorian alchemist who helped [[Daedroy Belkar]] save the [[Klaethor Vatiusen II|Prince]] from poison. He helped expose [[Tormac]]. He also fought alongside [[Richard Iwaelfhem]]. He was slain on the battlefield of the Aetate Foedus.

Stoic studied at Strixhaven alongside [[Miyatol Dodonus]], [[Daedroy Belkar]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Narnor Azerim]]. He and Daedroy wanted to save lives, and they proceeded to study medicine.

The pair reunited with Richard as he travelled to Oracus to warn the King of treason. There they met [[Baeor Dechaius]].

He and Daedroy were captured by the mysterious robes clad in green during one engagement with them.

After helping escort Richard, they returned to finish their studies. Stoic did not attend Richard's calls for help about Tormac, not quite believing their urgency.

Stoic's knowledge of alchemy was soon unparalleled. He met Theriad and developed data-storage crystals. He also created spells to study atoms, molecules, and chemistry.

When Daedroy was saving the Prince's life, he was able to procure Stoic a teleportation to and back from Oracus to aid him.

Stoic chose not to use his returning scroll, and stayed with his friends for a while, but used it when he chose to flee when he heard of the return of the great dragon Tormac.

He was greatly regretful of this, and ended up being a combat medic in the battle of the Aetate Foedus, where he was eventually killed in the assault on the medical tents by the warlock necromancer [[Voros Kaul]].
