King Klaethor was a half elf. He was a powerful and influential ruler who reigned for four hundred years, during which he published over three hundred mathematical proofs and magical rituals.

When Klaethor was a Prince, [[Tormac]] attempted to overthrow the [[Vatiusen]] house, and managed to assure the death of Klaethor's father, King Sil. Klaethor ascended to the throne shortly thereafter.

Klaethor was a member of the Vatiusen house, which specialized in diplomacy and foreign relations. 

He married Lady Mira. She died giving birth to his child Lyra. Lyra was very ill and when she was fourteen, she was dying, and was sent to an eternal sleep in a demiplane where time would flow differently, so that she could live until the cure to her ailment was discovered. To ensure her safety, he faked her death.

 As King Klaethor lay dying at four hundred years old without any heirs, his councilors and advisors fought amongst themselves to manipulate him. They kept his condition secret from the public out of fear that it would cause chaos and unrest. When he eventually died, the ensuing chaos led to the rule of the nine houses.
