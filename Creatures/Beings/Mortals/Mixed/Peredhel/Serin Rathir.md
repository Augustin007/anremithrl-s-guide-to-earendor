#### **Physical Appearance**

Serin is a delicate-looking half-elven girl, standing at about 4'5". Her elvish heritage is minimal, and cannot be seen in her rounded ears. It is more evident in her large, unblinking green eyes, which seem to see far more than she lets on. Her eyes are striking, often making her seem older than she is, filled with a quiet, almost otherworldly intensity. Her skin has already completely healed from the poison. No blotches or scars are visible.

Her hair is a light, silvery-blonde, falling straight and fine to her shoulders. It’s often tangled, as she doesn’t seem to pay much attention to it. Serin’s movements are fluid and silent, reflecting her elvish grace, and she tends to stay on the edges of the group, observing more than participating.

Serin’s clothing is a bit too large for her small frame. She wears a grey cloak that she often pulls around herself, almost as if trying to hide or blend into the background. Her expression is usually neutral, with little emotion showing on her face, making it difficult for others to read her thoughts or feelings.

#### **Personality**
- **Quiet:** Serin is a child of few words. She rarely speaks, and when she does, it’s usually in a soft, almost whisper-like tone. Her silence isn’t due to shyness, but rather a deep-seated trauma that has made it difficult for her to express herself verbally.
- **Observant:** Serin misses nothing. She is highly perceptive, noticing details that others might overlook. This makes her an excellent observer, but she often keeps what she sees to herself, internalizing her thoughts and feelings.
- **Empathetic:** Serin is deeply empathetic, though she rarely shows it outwardly. She feels the emotions of those around her acutely, often mirroring their pain or joy in her own subdued way. She’s particularly attuned to the suffering of others, which can be both a gift and a burden.
- **Detached:** Due to her traumatic past and elven heritage, Serin is emotionally detached, rarely showing any outward signs of distress or happiness. She processes her emotions inwardly, which can make her seem cold or distant.
- **Comforting:** Despite her silence and detachment, Serin has a natural ability to comfort others, especially the younger children. She wordlessly comforts Kerran when he wakes up crying, using her presence and gentle actions to calm him without saying a word.
- **Internalized Emotions:** Serin doesn’t outwardly express her emotions often, but they run deep. When she’s scared, sad, or anxious, she tends to withdraw further into herself rather than seeking comfort from others. 
- **Intuitive:** Serin has a strong intuition, often sensing things before they happen or understanding situations without needing to be told. This intuition might be connected to her Wild Magic, making her acutely aware of the chaotic forces around her.
- **Insecure:** Serin doesn’t think her name is nice, reflecting a deeper insecurity about her identity. She doesn’t express this openly, but it influences her silence and detachment, as if she’s trying to hide from herself and the world.


#### **Backstory**
Serin was born in the outskirts of the city of Bremen, where she lived with her parents and younger brother. Her father was a woodsman and ranger, shunned for his elvish heritage, and her mother ran the houshold. Serin grew up in a loving, if somewhat sheltered, environment. She was always a quiet child, preferring the company of her thoughts and books over the noise of other children.

Her family entered the city to sell some goods when the city was attacked. Her brother was struck by debris and died in front of her. Her mother fell to the fumes over the body of her brother. There too, she would have fallen, had not her father yanked her into the safety of Naras's Wind Ward just before the Teleport. She watched her father get killed by the dragon in the last moment. 

The trauma of what she saw left her deeply scarred. Since then, she has retreated further into herself, becoming even more quiet and introspective.

Her elvish heritage has left her with some latent magic.

#### **Relationships with the Others**

- **Talor:**  
  - Serin is more attached to Talor than to the other adults, often staying close to him and finding comfort in his presence. She follows his lead and seems to trust him more than anyone else.

- **Liriel Danstal:**
