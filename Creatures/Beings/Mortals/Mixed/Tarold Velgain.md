It is said that Tarold has giant's blood in him, for he stands at eight feet tall. He barely discusses the past. His gaze is sharp, and he never really seems happy. He carries himself like a soldier. He isn't kind, but he isn't cruel either- he is pragmatic. Efficiency, survival, and competence are his priorities.

His long coat is lined with fur, worn from travel but still finely made. His armor, once pristine, now bears the marks of countless battles. His heavy greatsword, however, is immaculate, its runed hilt humming softly with enchantments, a weapon of a man who takes his craft seriously. A silver chain around his neck holds a small, circular charm and a wedding ring, neither of which he ever speaks of.

He was born into the crime-ridden, lawless land of Rymfel, where the strong took what they wanted and the weak learned to live in the shadows. The country was a vast swampland, ruled by Queen Tahlia Tormund, granddaughter of Asmodeus. For 400 years, she had sold titles of lordship and ladyship to the highest bidder—crime bosses, warlords, and mercenaries who governed their fiefs with iron fists and unchecked cruelty. Some cities were ruled by nobles, but even they bent the knee to wealth and power.

Tarold’s family had no wealth and no power. He did not know his father. His mother died in childbirth, leaving him and his siblings to be raised by their grandfather—his mother’s father, a bitter old man who had once been a member of a notorious assassin’s guild before he lost his leg in a failed contract.

He did not know his father. His mother died giving birth to him. He was brought up by his grandfather, his father's mother. His grandfather had been a member of an assasin's guild until he had lost his leg. His grandfather raised him with a cruel sense of discipline. There was no room for weakness. Tarold was trained in stealth, combat, and the art of silent killing, alongside his two elder siblings—his brother and his sister.

Occasionally, Tarold exhibited flashes of uncontrolled magic—something dangerous in Rymfel, where magic was feared and distrusted. His grandfather beat the magic out of him, training him to suppress it, to act as though it never existed.

He became good friends with his neighbour's daughter Nadira, who was a year younger than her was.

His older brother, Varric, was a sadist. He reveled in pain, testing the limits of what he could inflict on others. Tarold's sister, Elyse, tried to shield him from Varric’s cruelty, but she was never strong enough.

Tarold was ten when Elyse died. It was an accident, or at least that’s what Varric claimed. He had been torturing a Tarold and Elsha tried to stop him. One moment, she was standing; the next, she was crumpled on the ground, bleeding from where he had caved in her skull with his fists.

Their grandfather did nothing. He knew better than to challenge Varric directly. Instead, he plotted revenge in the only way he knew—silence, patience, and a knife in the dark.

Tarold was twelve when he found his grandfather’s body. The old man had finally made his move, but Varric had been faster. The assassin’s body lay sprawled in their home, his throat cut, a warning to Tarold that weakness would not be tolerated.

Tarold fled that night.

Too young to survive on his own, Tarold found himself in the Rymfelli military, lying about his age to enlist. He fought in border skirmishes, wielding a greatsword that should have been too large for him, yet he swung it with deadly precision. For five years, he fought, killed, and survived.

For five years, he fought as a soldier, learning discipline and tactics, but never staying long in one place.

But Rymfel was not a land that let its soldiers leave easily. He deserted when the opportunity arose, disappearing into the world beyond.

By seventeen, he had left the army behind, becoming a sellsword, a wandering knight-for-hire. He traveled across the eastern continent, learning languages, customs, and the ways of war. He picked up magical knowledge along the way, honing his latent sorcery, overcoming his fear of it.

He ended up leaving, and became a blade for hire, a wandering knight. Picking up a variety of skills as he travelled throughout most of the eastern continent, learning languages, and customs, and picking up knowledge of magic.

Thirteen years later he returned to Rymfel, intending only to pick up his grandfather's protection charm. A small circular bit of metal. 

Instead, he found his brother ruling the city, having risen in crime and power.

He avoided his brother.

There, he found Nadira. She had become a healer, a woman of quiet strength and deep resolve. Against his better judgment, Tarold allowed himself to love her. They married, and for the first time in his life, he tried to live an honest and peaceful existence.

But honesty didn’t pay well in Rymfel. Poverty crept in, and soon he was forced to take up work as a bounty hunter. He rose in the ranks, hunting criminals for coin, earning enough money to one day escape Rymfel properly.

where he met a childhood friend, a former neighbour, and fell in love. He married her and decided to stay there. While he at first attempted an ordinary job, the poverty in Rymfel quickly forced him to join the bounty hunter's guild. He rose in the ranks.

For years, he hunted criminals and outlaws, saving enough money to finally escape Rymfel with Nadira. He wanted to leave immediately, but she refused. She wanted to do it properly, to have the right papers, the right supplies. She wanted a life in Neros, but she didn’t want to cross the border as a fugitive.

She hadn't wanted to march off and forage through swamps and forests and ford rivers.

He should have forced her. He should have left. Instead, he waited.

Then Varric found them.

Tarold was arrested for desertion. He spent five years in prison, watching time slip away, knowing Nadira was alone. She didn't visit him, and he feared the worst. When he was finally released, he returned to find their home burned to the ground. After asking the neighbors, he discovered his brother had raped and killed her.

He found his brother, and challenged him.

It wasn’t a clean fight. It wasn’t a duel. It was a bloodbath, and when it was over, Tarold stood over his brother’s body, his blade slick with blood, and knew he could never stay in Rymfel again.

Varric had been lord of the city. Killing him made Tarold a wanted man.

He fled.

With nowhere left to go, Tarold sought passage out of Rymfel. He found a contact—someone who could smuggle him through the Nar Pass and into the safety of Neros.

They never made it.

Bandits ambushed them. His contact was killed, and Tarold barely escaped with his life. He managed to heal himself enough to stagger into Lanar, the border city of Neros. From there, he did what he had always done—he adapted.

By transferring his bounty hunter records from Rymfel’s guild, he fast-tracked his admittance into the Neroshi Adventurer’s Guild, securing temporary papers, and making his way into Neros.
