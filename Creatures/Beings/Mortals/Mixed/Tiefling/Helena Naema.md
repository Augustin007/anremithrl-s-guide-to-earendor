Helena comes from the capital of [[Neros]] and was raised with her older brother Dryon by her parents, both government bureaucrats. She was a creative child but didn’t discover her passion for music until Dryon gifted her a lute. She was very close with Dryon and he always encouraged her to follow her passions.

When Dryon turned 18 he decided the stuffy capital life wasn’t for him and struck out as an adventurer. Helena used music and poetry as a way to deal with the loneliness she felt after he left. While her parents recognized her natural talents and supported her they continually pushed her towards academics to groom her for government work.

Dryon wrote letters to Helena of his many adventures which inspired some of her early ballads. At 16 while performing at tavern as she strummed the final chord on her lyre, she noticed that not only did the sound vibrate the air but the mana around her as well as filling members of the audience with a sense of inspiration. 

Eventually Helena’s parents came to accept that they couldn’t stop her from pursuing her passions and she enrolled in –NAME– school for the arts. While enrolled Helena met her future wife Julie while playing at a noble’s ball.

  

Helena’s parents had never given up on pushing her into government service and they helped get her a starter job in the government's propaganda department. When she started Helena intended to quit her government position as soon as her musical career kicked off, but Julie’s parents were suspicious of Helena’s intentions. This motivated Helena to do whatever she could to rise in the ranks. During this time she tracked down a fey who had been spreading some news the crown thought better unshared. In exchange for Helena’s leniency the fey taught her how to use fey magic. Armed with these new skills, rising to a comfortable position was easy, and she gained the blessing of Julie’s parents. 

The two were happily married for a year before adopting their first child a human girl they named Wisteria. As Helena recognized the growing financial needs of her family she let go of any dreams of leaving government service. Seven years after Wisteria they adopted their second, a half-elf named Alexander. As Helena watched her children grow into unique and inquisitive individuals she slowly became disillusioned with the government and 

  

Her job has granted her a unique look into the cracks in the peace that had started forming long ago as she ends up being the one who has to plaster them over.

Player relationships

Rogue - Helena first met him when he dug a little too deep into a government affair. After a talking to about how sometimes a poor memory is a virtue, she recognized the value in having a partner outside the department. Since then they occasionally trade information and have a professional relationship. While she puts on a tough exterior around him secretly she just wants to keep him out of trouble as she appreciates his childlike wonder for collecting secrets.

Relations

Ravina (Mother)(Tiefling 70yrs.) - Retired lawyer/prosecutor. . 

Trydon (Father)(Tiefling 60yrs.) - Retired treasury department accountant. A q

Dryon (Brother)(Tiefling 49yrs) - Adventurer, Helena last heard from him about two years ago when he said he wanted to try his hand at being a “sailor”. 

Thinking of keeping him in reserve as a second character should Helena die I think it would be natural for her older brother to want to both avenge her death and provide for the family she would leave behind & leaving him as an adventurer means he could theoretically be wherever if needed.

Julie (Wife)(Elf 120yrs) - Julie is quite sensitive and her upbringing as a noble never prepared her for any. Best suited to the domestic sphere she is a doting mother and excellent homemaker. Julie does have a keen financial mind and manages the family budgeting she never questions where any “bonuses” come from. 

While she sees through Helenas lies she’s happy to feign obliviousness though she does worry about what trouble her wife could end up in.
