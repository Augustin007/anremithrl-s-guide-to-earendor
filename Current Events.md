This is the state of the world four years later, per the lore, where most campaigns are currently at.
Tie the events of Echoes onto this:

Auril's ice continues to spread. Auril has frozen much of the north of the continent of Foedus.

Azmodeus escaped Tartarus for some time by removing his own godhood and slipping out of the nine hells through the tree of names into the material plane. He gathers allies for vengeance, and attempts to find the Oathbreaker sword to sever the unbreakable bond between Nugget and Tartarus so that Tartarus stops coming after him. Carrying Nugget's soul around in a black gem.

Tartarus was released from the labyrinth of insanity, and he leads many of the betrayer gods in a new plan to destroy the trees, but this is a lie, as he hopes instead to unmake the material plane and free the Epic Dragons, creatures older than the gods, created by the Primordials like Tartarus, capable of destroying all the remaining gods, in an attempt to restore the age of primordial.

The Raven Queen and Tyr have lost their godly powers, and the Shadowfell is being invaded by the dark regions. Vecna hopes to take advantage of this.

The plane of air has been destroyed, trillions dead, and the primordial Akida killed. The circumstances are unknown, but her brothers and her sister , the other three elemental primordials, plot revenge.

A strange man known as the Storyteller and the Dealmaker seems to be connected with people from all sides. No one quite knows what he wants. He is called Marethyu.

The Lady of Pain mourns the escape of all her people from the City of Doors, and vows revenge against all mortals.

Shar's darkness has reentered the world, clinging to monsters and causing abberrations, and her clerics, necromancer Illithids, cause havoc as she whispers dark things to many people. She hopes to watch the next great eternal war, as she had with the primordials long before. 

Politics are askew. Countries squabble and betray over land and money, despite the looming threat. 

The invention of guns, and newer technological inventions revolutionize parts of the world.

The tragic killing of the dragon-king Remshi and the destruction of the lightwood leaves much of the continent of Foedus cut off from shipping supplies.


Azmodeus: hopes to survive, despite Tartarus having an unbreakable oath to kill him, and hopes to resurrect his brother. He hopes as well to come out on top, to return to the throne of the gods and take his vengeance. But he will settle for surviving. He is patient. As long as he survives he can win eventually. He allies himself with Tiamat's dragon-servants in the mortal plane, and uses his cunning words to gain countries and politicians to his side. No one quite knows how big his influence is. He hopes to find a way to release Tartarus of his oath, or to kill Tartarus. 

Tartarus & Shar: bringing the betrayer gods to his side, promising repayment for years in the seven hells and vengeance. Calls for a second Sundering war. But in reality hopes to bring back the age of Primordials and kill the upstart gods and their mortal creations.

The Dealmaker: What he plays at is unknown to all. This hook handed man seems one of the most dangerous and powerful entities. The gods dare not speak of him out loud. He was there when the first of the primordials came to an end. He is present at every birth and death.

The Traveller: A rising deity who hopes to save as many people as possible.

William Treaty, Colossus, and a few other mortals attempt to organise the mortal defence of the tree of names, with the help of the no-longer-deified Raven Queen and Tyr.

Groups attempt to survive the frozen north, and kill Auril, led by Krag.

The Cult of the Whispered One hopes to take the Shadowfell back under Vecna, using the chaos of everything else as a ladder.

Thalorin and the protector gods spend their energy defending the other side of the trees of sanctuary and trying to gather allies and prepare for war.
