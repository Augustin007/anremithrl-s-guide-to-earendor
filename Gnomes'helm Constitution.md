3. LEGITIMIZING the rule of the King as the enacting will of the Raven Queen, whereby it be in her holy power to influence the King’s continuance or divine downfall, by which otherwise no legitimate reason for deposition may be entered except by her Holiness’ celestial rite,

        1. “I swear by the Raven Queen, sovereign of the departed and guardian of the ethereal veil, by the spirits that traverse the Shadowfell, and by all the divine mysteries that govern the balance between life and death, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfill, according to my ability and judgment, this covenant and these stipulations: to hold the Raven Queen, my mentor in this sacred art, as esteemed as my forebears; to share my fortunes with her should she require aid; to regard her followers as my brethren, and to impart the knowledge of this divine craft to those chosen by her, if they desire to learn it, without demand of tribute or solemn vow; to disseminate her decrees, both spoken and unspoken, and all other wisdom to her acolytes and to those bound by her sacred oath, but to none other. I will employ the remedies granted to me by the Raven Queen to the benefit of those under her shadow according to my utmost ability and discernment; I will not yield to the corruption of her gifts nor allow them to be used for malevolence or injustice. Never will I invoke her power to end a life unjustly, nor will I interfere with the passing of souls. Into whatsoever realms I enter, I will do so to aid those bound for the Raven Queen's embrace, abstaining from all intentional malfeasance and iniquity, particularly from the exploitation of the living and the dead, be they free or fettered. And whatsoever I shall witness in the discharge of my duty, as well as in my dealings with beings of all realms, if it be what should remain unspoken, I will never reveal, holding such mysteries to be sacred. Should I uphold this oath with honor and unbroken faith, may I be forever esteemed among all beings for my life and for my art; but should I transgress it and perjure myself, may the reverse of fortune be my fate,”

12. ENDOW a birthright of citizenship among both The Chiefly Humans and The Humans of Wander,
    
13. DECLARING all who are born within Gnomes’Helm are inherently receptive of the right to citizenship,
    
14. ASSURING that any person may petition the king directly for citizenship,
    
15. STATING that in matters when the king is indisposed, citizenship petitioners may petition the Advisory Council for citizenship whereby they will be placed in a standby queue to later be approved by the King directly,
    
16. ANNOUNCING that the Advisory Council has no ability to grant citizenship,
    
17. ENFORCING the rules, regulations, and constitution of Gnomes’Helm be adhered to by both citizens and non-citizens alike, not granting the rights and liberties exclusive to citizens, rather, enforcing the consequences of the breakage of state laws upon non-citizens,
    
18. CLARIFYING in special circumstances where the influx of non-citizens exceeds 20% of the current population of Gnomes’Helm at a given time, that the King has sole responsibility to either wholly deny citizenship to them, or review them individually (according to 15) and allow them to be naturalized,
    
19. DECLARING only adults can be citizens and those who are children, by birth as a human anywhere, by birth within Gnomes’Helm, or by being a newly naturalized child-“citizen”, are inherently and forever promised this citizenship upon their biological and mental development of appropriate faculties as decided by objective academia,
    
20. RECOGNIZE the use of the Paros international standard tender as a means by which Gnomes’Helm may repay public foreign debts,
    
21. CONSTRUCT a cabinet of advisors, called the “Advisory Council”, subservient to King and loyal to the office, as follows:
    
    1. There must be one delegate from each of the following:
        
        1. The Chiefly Humans,
            
        2. The Humans of Wander,
            
        3. The First Gnomes,
            
        4. The Gnomes of Wander,
            
        5. The Alphytes,
            
    2. The process for electing delegates is to be decided in such a manner:
        
        1. A town hall shall be held every first day of every other year, encompassing all whom wish to have their wills known,
            
        2. Upon which case as one identifies their intent to run as a possible delegate, they will be either affirmed unanimously or, in the event of a challenger, be voted on head-to-head,
            
        3. Whereby, should the challenger lose, another vote shall be held to confirm the initial runner as the official delegate of said group (refer to 21:b:ii) where the previous challenger is now barred from voting entirely,
            
        4. Whereby, should the challenger win, another vote ought to be held in order to confirm now that this new possible delegate, by unanimous vote, as the true official delegate of said group (refer to 21:b:ii),
            
        5. In such cases where no more may challenge or vote in the town hall, the would-be delegate who was unable to be ousted immediately becomes the official delegate for the cabinet position by force-vote,
            
        6. In such cases where a group is not represented in the town hall and no such delegate can be chosen at that time, it is then the duty of the King to delegate, by order of a random selection of all persons within said groups, a person to that cabinet position,
            
22. ENACTING a course of constitutional amendment whereby past inaccuracies may be remedied,
    
    1. The King has inherited right, for the betterment of the citizenry, to propose and self-ratify amendments to the constitution should the need arise,
        
    2. The Advisory Council, by a vote to be kept secret from the King of these three to five, may enter amendment proceedings,
        
        1. Amendment proceedings may last for an unenumerated period until, by a unanimous vote in favor of ceasing, may the proceedings end,
            
    3. The citizenry may possibly enter amendment proceedings in the following method:
        
        1. A petition must be made known to the King who, in speedy time, must hold a special vote in a town hall of all who wish to be heard,
            
        2. Of the present, 20% or more must vote in favor of entering proceedings, whereby they must begin against the wills of the King and the Advisory Council,
            
        3. Of the present, should 20% or more not vote in favor of entering amendment proceedings, the petition is to be left unanswered,
            
        4. Once opened, amendment proceedings for the constitution must be handled as per 22:b:i,
            
    4. Amendments resultant of proceedings from both the Advisory Council and the citizenry are ultimately to the discretion of the King to officially ratify into the constitution, even after a just proceeding for new amendments had been made prior,
        
    5. After a round of constitutional amendment proceedings has commenced as per 20:b:i, arising from either the Advisory Council directly or the citizenry in general, no such exact amendments may be proposed in the next-possible-to-come constitutional amendment proceeding.
