**Language of Cherhal: Chersai**

Cherhal, a warlike nation in the far southern reaches near Echoriati and Chiss, has developed a language as harsh and efficient as its militaristic culture and brutal institutions. The people of Cherhal prize dominance, unwavering order, and loyalty—values baked into the structure of Chersai, their common tongue.

## 1. **Phonology & Pronunciation**

**Consonants:**

- **Stops/Affricates:** p, t, k, (q)*, b, d, g
- **Fricatives:** f, s, sh, kh, h
- **Nasals:** m, n
- **Liquids:** l, r
- **Glides:** w, y

*(q) is a uvular stop, produced far back in the mouth, giving some words a harsh, guttural quality.

**Vowels:**

- **Short:** a, e, i, o, u
- **Long:** ā, ē, ī, ō, ū (when stressed or held longer)

**Stress:**

- Typically falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable.
- In words referencing high authority or strong emotion, Cherhali speakers often elongate the stressed vowel for emphasis (e.g., “Krā­tash!”—Victory!).

**Phonotactics & Sound Feel:**

- Clusters of consonants are common, reflecting Cherhal’s hard, quick, commanding style of speech: e.g., “Strak,” “Narkheth.”
- Harsh fricatives like “kh” (voiceless velar fricative) are frequent in words linked to conflict or aggression.

## 2. **Writing System**

Chersai uses a runic script carved historically on stone tablets and branding irons (for marking slaves). It consists of angular glyphs that are easily cut or chiseled. In modern times, it is also written with quills on parchment or leather, retaining the angular style.

## 3. **Core Grammar**

1. **Word Order:**
    
    - Predominant word order is **SVO** (Subject–Verb–Object), though for emphasis, Cherhali warriors often place the verb first in commanding speech (e.g., “Kill them” might appear as **Kat sehal!** or simply **Kat!**).
2. **Nouns & Cases:**
    
    - Nouns have a simplified **case** system, primarily **nominative** (subject) and **object** (direct object), marked by suffixes:
        - **Nominative:** no suffix (root form).
        - **Object:** _-en_ (attached to the end).
        - Example:
            - “Narkheth” (slave) → **Narkheth** (when subject), **Narkhethēn** (when object).
3. **Gender & Number:**
    
    - **No strict grammatical gender** in everyday usage.
    - Plural suffix: _-ash_ or _-esh_ if the noun ends in a vowel.
        - “Slave” (narkheth) → **narkhethash** (“slaves”).
4. **Pronouns:**
    
    - **I / me:** _zan_ (subject) / _zanen_ (object)
    - **you (singular):** _tol_ / _tolen_
    - **he / she / they (singular):** _or_ / _oren_
    - **we / us:** _zanash_ / _zanash-en_
    - **you (plural):** _tolash_ / _tolash-en_
    - **they (plural):** _orash_ / _orash-en_
5. **Verbs & Conjugation:**
    
    - Verbs typically end in _-t,_ _-k,_ or _-l_ in their infinitive: e.g., **kat** (“to kill”), **strak** (“to seize”), **anol** (“to serve”).
    - **Present Tense** is unmarked (infinitive form).
    - **Past Tense:** add _-a_ to the end (if the verb ends in a consonant) or _-da_ (if the verb ends in a vowel)
        - _kat_ → _kata_ (“killed”)
        - _anol_ → _anolda_ (“served”)
    - **Imperative:** The bare root is used with a raised or harsh tone: “**Kat!**” (“Kill!”).
    - **Future Tense:** preface the verb with **mar** (similar to “will” in Common): _mar kat_, _mar anol_, etc.
6. **Adjectives & Adverbs:**
    
    - Often placed **after** the noun or verb they modify: e.g., “Cherhal strong” = **Cherhal ryt**; “Fight fiercely” = **ferr khat ryt**.
    - Some common suffixes:
        - _-ryt_ for something strong or forceful,
        - _-nai_ for something honorable,
        - _-dre_ for something cursed or tainted.

## 4. **Cultural Linguistic Features**

1. **Honorifics:**
    
    - **Rakh-** used as a prefix for high nobility or war leaders. A “rakh” is effectively an overlord or warlord.
        - E.g., “**Rakh-Hydor**” is “Lord Hydor” in a commanding sense.
    - **Chal-** used for acknowledged champions or conquerors.
        - E.g., “**Chal-Vala**” might be an esteemed general.
2. **Titles & Slave Terminology:**
    
    - **Mordash** = “property,” a catch-all term for slaves, animals, or conquered goods.
    - **Narkheth** = “slave,” especially in formal references, a more direct term.
    - **Dovr** = “bond,” used to reference personal loyal servants who are not mere property but forcibly sworn for life.
    - **Tashvar** = “freeman” (someone who is under no bondage).
3. **War & Conquest Phrases:**
    
    - **Krātash!** = “Victory!” (exclamation, often used at the end of a successful raid/battle)
    - **Rath orn!** = “No mercy!” (literally “spare none!”)
    - **Chorsha enek!** = “Break them!” (a phrase used to demoralize the enemy)
4. **Customary Greetings & Partings**
    
    - **Greeting (Formal):** “**Zan chal-eh?**” (“Am I facing a champion?”) – used ironically or respectfully to size up the person greeted.
    - **Response (Formal):** “**Tol rakh-neh.**” (“You face a lord.”) – politely combative, acknowledging a rank or rightful station.
    - **Parting (Common):** “**Strak nai.**” (“Seize honor.”) – a farewell urging the other to keep or earn their honor.

Pronounce the guttural _q_ and _kh_ distinctly. Extend the penultimate syllable in important, weighty words (like _Krá-tash_).
## 7. **Using Chersai in Your Campaign**

- **Cultural Depth:** Every time you feature a Cherhali character, lean into the directness and harshness of the language. Even greetings have a latent threat or challenge woven into them.
- **Slavery & Status:** Different words for bondsmen and property can underscore the horrifying normalcy of lifelong slavery in Cherhal. NPCs might refer to their slaves as _mordash_ or _narkheth,_ depending on whether they see them purely as objects or (more ironically) “people who serve.”
- **Military Jargon:** You can accent key phrases in the party’s encounters with Cherhali soldiers—cries of “**Rath orn!**” or “**Krātash!**” to emphasize the unstoppable war machine of Cherhal’s legions.
- **Roleplaying Accents:** Pronounce the guttural _q_ and _kh_ distinctly. Extend the penultimate syllable in important, weighty words (like _Krá-tash_).
