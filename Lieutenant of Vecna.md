### üîß Tips for Use & Customization

1. **Tiered Threats:** Use the High Priest and Mindspore Harbinger in tandem‚Äîone to cast powerful battlefield spells, the other to control and finish enemies. The Bone Knight acts as the heavy frontline muscle.
    
2. **Secret Agendas:** Let the High Priest extract truths mid-combat to sow discord in your party. He might learn a PC‚Äôs secret and twist it against them.
    
3. **Resist Legacy:** All three share necrotic/psychic resistances, reflecting Vecna‚Äôs corrupting presence. That makes raw force less effective‚Äîencourage players to strategize.
    
4. **Customization Hooks:**
    
    - Replace cleric-style spells with necromantic rituals or runic curses.
        
    - Reskin Bone Knight‚Äôs armor to glyph-inscribed lich-plate.
        
    - Tie each lieutenant to a physical Vestige or artifact of Vecna (e.g. Bone Knight‚Äôs greatsword is inscribed with a fragment of Vecna‚Äôs Eye, granting the wielder dark visions).
        
5. **Legendary Synergy:** Use legendary actions to keep the pressure on PCs and avoid ‚Äúone hit, dead‚Äù issues typical of static NPCs.
