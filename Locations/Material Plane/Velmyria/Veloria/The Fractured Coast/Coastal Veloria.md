**Foundation**
The Great War, known also as the War of Earendor, and the 800-year-war, was an international conflict that spanned accross most planes of existence. Its end sparked the creation of a flurry of international laws and alliances which were hoped would stop such a war from ever occurring again.

The Treaty of Boscombe was one such document, which first and foremost formalised the notion of nations and land they owned, imposing laws to concretise what it meant for some piece of land to belong to a country and how countries could claim land. 

Under the laws of this treaty, The United Kingdom of Veloria was considered to be in posession of large swaths of land across Velmyria, and indeed, Veloria took great advantage of this international backing to occupy areas it now technically possessed, disregarding any inhabitants of the area. 

But the treaty also included clauses that limited how much land and coastline could be controlled by a single country. Veloria, whose mercantile reach had stretched too far and too fast, found itself in violation of these new international laws. Under threat of diplomatic isolation, and to preserve its more vital holdings, Veloria was under pressure to cede some of its coastal territories.

At the same time, there was unrest in the Southeastern regions. These lands had long been neglected. The terrain was treacherous, the winters storm-wracked from proximity to the Chaos Rift in Hatreth, and the soil too thin to farm reliably. Though the provinces there claimed alliegence to the UKV, they had accrued resentment from being long-neglected due to its difficult terrain and lesser importance. Starved of supplies during the war, their sense of abandonment had fermented into regional nationalism.

Thus, in the year 4610, the Velorian Senate ratified the Treaty of Coastal Veloria, formally ceding its southeastern territories.

Coastal Veloria siezed its independence gladly, swiftly establishing a bicameral parliament in Seaward, formed of a Council and a Senate. Former UKV governors and veterans from the Great War were elected into positions of power. They swore to forge a nation grounded in mutual support and maritime cooperation.


**Geography**
Its territory once ran along the southeastern edge of the Velorian continent. The geography has not changed much in the years since. There, the land narrows into cliffs, marshes, and storm-battered inlets. The proximity to the Chaos Rift in Hatreth means that winter and spring batter the coast with terrible destructive storms, leaving barren land behind. These storms distort teleportation, split stone, uproot trees, disable communication spells, and ravage infrastructure.

This chaotic geography both isolates and protects. In the stormless months, trade flows freely and port cities flourish. In the Stormmonths, powerful keeps and rune-inscribed bunkers shelter cities from the worst of the elements. Towns arose wherever nature provided shelter, as travel and agriculture were nigh-impossible during much of the year.

From this arose what the philosopher Veden claimed was Coastal Veloria's defining paradox: the difficulty of travel isolated the various provinces, but their lack of self-sufficiency made them utterly dependent on each other. What had begun as a hopeful coalition quickly revealed its fragility.


**Maritime Acts**
The new nation was composed of disparate city-states and coastal provinces—some Myrian, some Velorian, some fiercely independent. The only unifying thread had been their shared resentment of the UKV. Without a common enemy, old grievances re-emerged. Provinces argued, withheld trade, and threatened secession. But for a time, the Council and Senate proved effective at resolving disputes, preserving a tenuous peace.

Even as it lost territory, the UKV had not relinquished influence. Merchant Lords from Whiteport and Goldmedow quietly backed political candidates and funded port construction along Coastal Veloria’s harbors. While publicly framed as "economic aid," it became clear that these were attempts to steer the young republic’s trade policies and ensure continued dependency on Velorian goods and networks.

Tensions soared in 4616 when the Maritime Consortium, a coalition of trading companies, began lobbying for control over key customs duties in Seaward. Some of the coastal clans and city councils resisted, citing the very independence they had fought for, and laws were passed regulating these matters in the Coastal Velorian Maritime Act of 4616. These laws were incredibly unpopular, and Capjus, the largest and most developed province, felt that they restricted its freedom to deal with merchants and the Maritime Consortium as they wished, and demanded the right to individually negotiate tariffs and shipping laws.

The Coastal Velorian Maritime Act of 4617 granted Capjus and several other states more independence. Those that were excluded, mostly the smaller states, were outraged, fearing trade would be attracted to the larger provinces, and claimed corruption had swayed the Senate, for money changed minds more than words ever did. After much debate, the act would go on to be dissolved later the same year, with the senate resolving to enact new laws and regulation the next time they met.

Seeing the main body of tariff laws collapse so quickly, the provinces scrambled to exploit the lack of regulation. They delayed Senate meetings, jockeyed for favorable positions, and seized regional control over customs enforcement.

Internal tariffs, blockades, and trade skirmishes followed. Pirates and slavers made port in Sable. The city, desperate for revenue, became a hub of illicit trade, causing outrage in Srash and Ki’kin, who attempted to organize boycotts. Famine spread as trade routes fell into disarray. People died of starvation both in Coastal Veloria and in northern Hatreth.


**Skeruk Crisis**
The disarray in trade and agriculture brought on by the failure of the Maritime Acts had far-reaching consequences beyond internal squabbles. The famine that swept through Coastal Veloria and parts of northern Hatreth had a spillover effect into the already fragile nation of Ma'ker, to the south. As crops failed and infrastructure collapsed, the region saw a massive emigration wave into Coastal Veloria, primarily through the porous and under-defended border at Skeruk.

Skeruk, already grappling with raids and banditry, now found itself swamped by thousands of starving refugees, as well as roaming warbands from Ma'ker who sought to survive by raiding villages. Entire townships collapsed under the pressure. Skeruk's Council of Generals petitioned the Senate and Council of Coastal Veloria for immediate support, requesting supplies, reinforcements, and authority to implement emergency defenses. But the other provinces were too embroiled in their own crises—boycotts, uprisings, and trade collapses—to send aid.

Desperate, Skeruk turned to the United Kingdom of Veloria. Within weeks, Velorian forces arrived from the south, bringing food, military engineering units, and magical aid. They helped fortify Skeruk’s borders and drove off the raiders.

The act was a lifeline to Skeruk—but a match to powder elsewhere. The rest of Coastal Veloria erupted in outrage. Capjus and Soz'kes accused Skeruk of treason, claiming it had invited foreign occupation. Propaganda declared that Skeruk had "rejoined the yoke of imperialism." Despite the complexities of the situation, the narrative of betrayal caught fire.

In late 4623 AS, a coalition force—hastily assembled by the Senate and Council—marched on Skeruk. The Velorian soldiers and volunteers were slaughtered. Those from Skeruk who housed them or attempted to defend them were massacred. The leaders of Skeruk’s Council of Generals were executed on the town square of Skeruk's capital. Velorian banners were burned in the squares. The memory of the event would later be known as the Skeruk Massacre, a brutal turning point in the unraveling of the republic.

The act solidified Capjus’s narrative that the central government had lost legitimacy. It also ensured that Skeruk, when the republic fell, would never again trust its neighbors—or anyone.

The Skeruk Massacre did not go unnoticed by the United Kingdom of Veloria. Though their involvement had initially been limited to humanitarian aid and border stabilization, the execution of their officers by Coastal Velorian forces was seen as a brutal betrayal. News of the massacre ignited a firestorm of outrage in the Velorian Senate and among the merchant houses of Whiteport and Goldmedow, many of whom had been funding relief efforts.

In diplomatic circles, the UKV ceased all recognition of the Coastal Velorian government, branding it a rogue regime and revoking all maritime treaties signed since its independence. Naval patrols were rerouted to avoid the Fractured Coast, and embargoes were quietly enforced on goods traveling through Capjan-controlled ports.

The Attendants of Knowledge publicly condemned the massacre, declaring that the republic had "forsaken law and decency, and surrendered to barbarism." Memorials to the fallen Velorian engineers and soldiers were erected along the southern coast of the UKV, and a shrine was built in Lorekeep, turning the incident into a symbol of martyrdom and imperial dignity.

Within, the reaction was equally explosive. Insurgent groups began rising in Skeruk, inciting a call for rebellion which resonated with many of the people of the smaller states. Riots broke out in Sable and Soz'kes. Piracy surged as local militias seized shipping lanes to fund themselves, cutting off what little remained of sanctioned trade.

Within a year, the republic's first Prime Minister, Telandros Meer of Srash, was captured by insurgents. In a symbolic and cruel execution, was bound and left without shelter overnight during the first stormmonth of 4626 AS. 


**The Ministerial Compromise**
The resulting election became one of the longest and most contentious in the republic's short history, lasting over a year. Capjus rallied behind its candidate, Ysil Dorneth, offering political and logistical support to both Skeruk and Srash—the two largest states—in exchange for their votes. Meanwhile, the smaller provinces rallied behind Faelorin Pell, who had become a symbol of resistance against Capjus’s growing dominance.

When Ysil ultimately won the election, tensions worsened. Many in the smaller provinces viewed him as a puppet of Capjus and a usurper of the republic’s democratic ideals. Still, true to his word, Ysil did send aid to Skeruk and Srash. 

Then, in a bold attempt to unify the crumbling state, he brokered the Ministerial Compromise. This compromise drastically restructured the government: it diminished the powers of the Prime Minister—now called the First Minister—and created a new office, the Second Minister, held by Faelorin Pell. The executive authority became a rotating council, and term limits were introduced for all government positions. In a final conciliatory gesture, Ysil reinstated the Maritime Act of 4616, though amended to ensure more equitable enforcement and some of the freedoms that had led to the forging of the 4617 Act.

These reforms, however, satisfied no one. Ysil faced constant opposition, riots, and multiple assassination attempts. Though Faelorin and Ysil had become friends during the effort, it was not enough to save him. In 4627 AS, a mob descended upon his home, dragged him into the street, and murdered him by bludgeoning his skull with a storm-weathered stone. Faelorin was granted position of both first and second minister. 

Following Ysil's death, Capjus, outraged and embittered, banned trade with any port that did not swear allegiance to Capjus, minted its own currency, and argued that the amended Maritime Act violated key clauses of the original Treaty of Coastal Veloria, thus invalidating the ministerial compromise. These efforts strained Capjus's resources, eventually forcing them to end all aid to Skeruk shortly thereafter.


**The Dissolution Pact**
In 4628 AS, a Capjan warship mistakenly intercepted and sank what it believed to be a Sable pirate vessel approaching Skeruk. In truth, the ship was carrying Governor Thalein Vess of Sable—traveling in secret to Skeruk to discuss a proposed alliance and joint naval patrols. The incident was a diplomatic disaster. The Capjan admiral claimed ignorance, but few believed it was an accident.

The death of Governor Vess was taken as an assassination. The government of Sable took it to the Senate and Council. Fearing secession by Capjus, they acquitted the captain. Sable, already teetering toward outright rebellion, erupted into fury. Within weeks, Sable's pirate fleets launched a coordinated assault on Seaward, storming the city’s defenses and burning it to the ground. The Senate chambers were razed, and many central government officials were slain or disappeared. Every bit of wealth was robbed from the place. 

This violent crescendo forced the hand of the remaining provinces. In 4630 AS, all the remaining states—except Capjus—gathered and signed the Dissolution Pact, formally ending the Republic of Coastal Veloria and acknowledging the independence of each province.


**Capjus**
Capjus refused to acknowledge the pact, branding it illegal and unconstitutional. Determined to preserve the illusion of continuity, it constructed a grand new Senate and Council chamber within its capital and continued to 'elect' members to the now-defunct republican bodies. Though fully aware that a legal quorum was unattainable without the participation of other provinces, Capjus insisted that the republic still legally existed and that all other provinces were in unlawful secession.

For nearly two centuries, this spectacle of phantom governance endured. The self-appointed Senate convened in ritualistic sessions, enacting performative legislation that had no force of law. With no quorum, they could not amend statutes or ratify treaties. Instead, they held mock trials for exiled politicians, issued ceremonial proclamations, and debated matters that no longer concerned anyone but themselves. Even Capjan merchants and bureaucrats largely ignored these decrees.

Eventually, Capjus's civil authorities declared formal secession from the Republic of Coastal Veloria, though in an absurd contradiction, they maintained that the land housing the Senate and Council chambers did not belong to Capjus at all—but to the still-extant legal body of Coastal Veloria. Under the Treaty of Boscombe, however, that land is recognized as Capjan territory.

To this day, the legacy of this elaborate denial lives on. Capjan official rhetoric continues to refer to the other successor states collectively as "Coastal Veloria," insisting they seceded unlawfully and should be brought back into the fold. Maps produced in Capjus still depict a unified coastline, only marking Capjus as lawfully seceded, with footnotes and annotations asserting historical claims.

Its government functions more as a junta, dominated by naval commanders and merchant-admirals. With the largest shipyards and port cities still under its control, Capjus initiated trade wars against rival provinces, often using privateers as deniable instruments of coercion. Simultaneously, it established the Office of Maritime Intelligence, a powerful spy network rumored to have assets in every major port across Velmyria. Though it still speaks the language of unity, its ambitions are increasingly imperial.


**Skeruk**
Skeruk, isolated and hardened by war, declared itself a Martial Republic governed by a Council of Generals. Its society quickly transformed into one built around military efficiency and a code of self-reliance. Scarred by betrayal and famine, Skeruk adopted a doctrine of armed neutrality, refusing all treaties and alliances with its former neighbors. They fortified their mountain passes and harbor towns, sealing their borders

In the aftermath of the Skeruk Massacre, the collective trauma shaped not just governance, but cultural identity. Every citizen undergoes military training; political leadership is restricted to those with battlefield command experience. Outsiders are viewed with suspicion, and citizenship is earned, not assumed. The cities are grim and austere, their architecture built from storm-split stone, engraved with warnings rather than ornament.

Despite its isolation, Skeruk is not stagnant. It has invested heavily in siegecraft, magical countermeasures, and earth-binding rituals to resist teleportation-based assaults. While trade is minimal, their forges produce superior arms and wards, which are occasionally smuggled out by black market intermediaries. Diplomatically, Skeruk speaks rarely—but when it does, other nations listen, for its threats are never idle.

Their motto, "No aid. No debt. No weakness," is etched into every civic building. It is less a motto than a law, the cornerstone of their grim stability.


**Ki'kin**
Ki'kin embraced isolation with decadence and deadly elegance. Governed by the secretive House Nesherai, whose bloodline claims descent from ancient Myrian priests, Ki'kin fused statecraft and ritual. Every major office is secured through oath-bound blood trials, and assassination—when sanctioned—is seen not as a crime, but as a statement of political clarity. The elite assassins' guild, the Ivory Coil is based here.

Foreign ambassadors are monitored constantly and often forced to wear protective charms against local pollen. Despite its fearsome reputation, Ki'kin maintains trade in rare alchemical substances and botanical toxins, which are exported through intermediaries in Grathi or Srash.

While most nations fear Ki'kin’s spies, they respect its resolve. The government projects a composed exterior of serenity and shadow, but internally it is ruled by factional intrigue and ritualized rivalries. Even the common folk speak in riddles and proverbs, and every festival carries at least one symbolic execution, often chosen randomly from the village. 


**Srash**
Srash capitalized on the chaos by declaring total financial neutrality, transforming itself into a sovereign bank-state. The city’s ruling body, known only as the Twelve Ledgers, consists of faceless financiers whose identities are kept hidden even from their closest associates. No king or general leads Srash—only credit, contract, and influence. Every major decision is weighed against its potential economic yield, and laws are passed not by vote, but by a calculus of risk and profit.

As trust in government eroded across the coast, Srash offered stability—not through arms, but through gold. It became the vault for mercenaries, warlords, and merchants alike. Nearly every major power, both local and foreign, established embassies, banks, and shell companies within its marble districts. The city hosts a thriving black ledger market, and is notorious for laundering money from Rymfel, Hatreth, and beyond. While it claims neutrality, Srash's reach is anything but passive. It funds trade expeditions, underwrites wars, and manipulates currencies across Velmyria.

In Srash streets are clean, guards are polite, and contracts are sacred. Betray a deal here, and you may never do business again. The Twelve Ledgers funded Tal'berius Tarillion's research and contracted him to design for them a type of construct, known as the Taxblade, and these terrifying enforcers ensure debts are always paid.


**Shagez**
Sable established a republic shortly after the dissolution pact. The Republic of Sable lasted for less than a week before a group of pirate captains razed its capital and took over most cities. Sable was thus reborn as Shagez. Shagez thus shed its republican past and emerged as the pirate capital of Earendor. Its deep-water harbors, hidden coves, and naturally defensible cliffs made it the perfect base for corsairs, smugglers, and warlords. In the power vacuum left behind by the republic’s collapse, a new form of rule emerged—the Chaincouncil, a rowdy assembly of captains, slavers, mutineers, and rogue mages. There is no formal succession. Power is earned by conquest, fear, and gold.

The Chaincouncil meets in the Saltspire, a massive tower made of bright white stone. Council sessions are loud, theatrical, and occasionally lethal. Any captain with a ship and a fleet loyal enough can call a vote—so long as they survive the night. Deals are sealed with storm-salt and bloodwine, and broken with fire. While chaotic, the Chaincouncil maintains a tenuous balance by enforcing The Shagez Code, which all pirates must pretend to follow. Let it be known you broke the code, and the whole port may rise to claim your head. It is expected the pirates will break it, but it is meant to be done in secret and not be spoken of. 

Despite—or because of—its lawlessness, Shagez thrives. It trades in stolen goods, outlawed magic, and exotic beasts, and has become a black-market hub for everything from cursed relics to forbidden knowledge. Whispers speak of hidden vaults beneath the drowned catacombs, where demon cults offer tribute to storm-gods in exchange for safe voyages and violent tides. It is a place where bards die young, and cartographers lie for coin.


**Soz'kez**
Soz'kes, though small, emerged as the moral and ideological heart of the original rebellion. Refusing to abandon the founding ideals of Coastal Veloria, Soz'kes embraced a vision of governance grounded in radical democracy and absolute bureaucracy. Every citizen has the right to vote, propose legislation, and challenge any official decision—but all such rights are mediated through an intricate system of scrollwork, civic tokens, witness panels, and public readings. Laws are not passed so much as they are survived.

The Central Citizen Assembly, a sprawling parliament of rotating delegates, meets daily in the Agora of Ash—a labyrinthine chamber whose records stretch for miles in magically copied parchment. Each motion must pass through three readings, two appeals, and a public review period, often involving thousands of citizens at once. Entire civic guilds are dedicated to interpretation of precedents and commentary on rival interpretations. Titles such as "First Scribe of the Veto" and "Reviser of Emergency Amendments" carry more power than generals.

Following the assassination of Ysil Dorneth, the Assembly of Ash was founded—a confederate movement within Soz’kes that advocates for rebuilding a cooperative coast rooted in mutual respect and legal clarity. Though they have struggled to expand, their doctrine has taken hold in some border towns disillusioned by war.

Soz'kes suffers from frequent populist uprisings and factional gridlock, but its people remain passionately invested. They believe bureaucracy is not a burden, but a shield against tyranny. Every law is argued, every vote contested, and every official address is accompanied by an annotated rebuttal. The result is chaotic, but fiercely just—at least in the minds of its citizens.

To outsiders, Soz'kes is a maddening warren of paper, passion, and procedural warfare. But to those within, it is proof that governance by the people can endure—even if it takes seven stamps, five hearings, and a storm-season to do so.


**Razresh**
Razresh was retaken by the native Myrians, though a different clan than that which took Ki'kin. Its people cling fiercely to the old spirit paths—ancestral rites that predate even the founding of the republic. Governance in Razresh is handled not by councils or assemblies, but by a loosely federated network of spirit-seers, omen-scribes, and bone-diviners. These mystics interpret signs in the wind, tides, and blood of animals.

Visitors rarely find welcome. Outsiders are viewed as spiritless and deaf to the land’s will. Entry into Razresh often requires undergoing ritual stormfasting, where one is left in the high cliffs during a Chaos Storm with only painted charms for protection. Those who return unharmed are marked as ‘storm-touched’ and may speak with elders. Few do.

Razresh trades sparingly—mostly herbs, obsidian talismans, and wind-carved stones believed to contain trapped voices of the dead. It has no standing army, yet few dare provoke it. Storms seem to turn against invaders. Some believe the shamans speak not just to spirits, but to the storm itself.


**Grathi**
Grathi became a grimy industrial state powered by its salt-forges, smoke-choked manufactories, and labyrinthine underground trade routes. Located on the northern edge of the stormbelt, its cities are built into cliffside caverns, with massive chain-pulley lifts hoisting goods from dock to forge. Its people are pragmatic, hardy, and deeply suspicious of outsiders. Officially neutral, Grathi is ruled not by nobles or elected officials, but by a Rotary Syndicate of forge-masters, smugglers, and trade barons who barter influence in an ever-shifting alliance of necessity.

Grathi has no written constitution, only contracts and vendettas. Its justice system is clan-based, and blood-dues are still practiced in the outer towns. Despite its apparent lawlessness, it functions with a ruthless internal logic: keep the salt moving, and stay out of each other's business. The forges of Grathi are known for producing storm-tempered iron and rune-bound machinery, some of which borders on arcane automation. These goods are in high demand across the Fractured Coast—particularly in Ki'kin, with whom Grathi maintains a shadow alliance through black-market toxin and metal trades.
