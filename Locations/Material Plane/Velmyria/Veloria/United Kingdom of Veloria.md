**The Crown of Velmyria**

**Foundation**
Groups of people, seeking to escape the warlord [[Hechilspet]]'s reach, fled onboard ships, hoping to reach Hatreth. Blown off course by a storm, and with damaged ships and equipment, the refugees did the best they could to continue Westward, repairing sails out of their own clothes.

After weeks at sea, only one of the four ships remaining, the refugees found a natural harbor, with two rivers, Sylthor and Therin (Silver and Gold), far from any civilization they new. And thus they named the region the Untamed Lands, and called their first settlement Veloria, after the sails of the ships that got them there. This was the year 3105 AS, according to most estimates. 

They spent three years there, founding Veloria, before they had repaired their ships and equipment enough to figure out where they were. Quickly, they realised they were very far further North and West than they had intended, and a group of people left the settlement to reach [[Vedia]], as they had intended. News of their success reached peoples in Sunktopeth and Foedus,

Soon thereafter, twenty-five ships, laden with supplies, left from port Ilithandor at Nolorei. They landed at the mouth of the Maren River, eighty miles South. There was founded the settlement of Marencia in the year 3110 AS.

By the year 3125, dozens of such settlments, including Eryndel, Whiteport, and Goldmedow had been founded. Groups of people who lived in these lands before the settlers were discovered. The settlers named these natives Myrians.

By 3250, a combination of pacts had created groups of colonies claiming land across the coasts of the new continent

Over the course of the next two centuries, skirmishes and wars between these colonies greatly hindered progress.

The Unification Pact, agreed upon in 3450 AS, The colonies formally united under a common government, creating the first Velorian Senate, and founding the United Kingdom of Veloria.

**United Kingdom of Veloria**

The Velorian Senate was established as the governing body, comprised of representatives from each major city and province. Unlike the monarchies of Varethis, the UKV adopted a system where a king was elected by the Senate every ten years, a symbolic leader whose power was checked by the Senate’s authority. While intended to be a figurehead, early kings wielded significant influence, especially in military and diplomatic matters.

Military Standardization began in 3470 AS. The independent militias of the colonies were merged into the Royal Velorian Guard, creating a professional army capable of defending against piracy and external threats.

By 3490, the majority of the laws were codified.

In the year 3510, Theriad Keladri established the Lorekeep a week's ride following the Sylthor river from Veloria.

This period saw rapid urbanization, with cities like Marencia, Goldmedow, and Whiteport flourishing into centers of commerce, politics, and knowledge. However, tensions with native Myrian tribes escalated, leading to conflicts known as the Myrian Wars (3525-3580 AS). Despite fierce resistance, the Myrians were gradually pushed further inland or assimilated into Velorian society.

With its borders secured, Veloria turned its focus outward. The Exploration Charter of 3625 AS launched state-sponsored expeditions into the interior of Velmyria, mapping unknown lands and establishing new colonies. 

All the way through to the late 3700s, settlers pushed further and further inland, securing farmlands and mineral-rich territories.

In the early 3800s, the UKV began annexing coastal settlements further south in an attempt to curtail piracy. By this time, Veloria controlled one of the largest merchant fleets in the world. The adoption of the Neroshi Paros as the official currency strengthened its economic ties to Foedus.

While expansion brought prosperity, it also led to internal strife. Many Myrians resisted the cultural dominance of Veloria, leading to sporadic uprisings. In response, the Senate implemented the Integration Reforms (3880 AS), granting certain tribal leaders seats in local governance.

By 3900 AS, as expansion reach the opposite coast, Veloria had firmly established itself as a dominant power, but its rapid expansion led to concerns of overreach.

The turn of the 4th millennium AS was fraught with conflict. While Veloria had built a powerful economy and military, its growing influence sparked tensions with neighboring powers.

The War of Two Thrones(3925-3980 AS)

A diplomatic crisis erupted when two claimants to the Velorian throne emerged, from two different interpretations of the constitution, leading to a prolonged civil war. This conflict ended with the Second Senate Reform (3980 AS), which reduced the power of the monarchy even further. From this point onward, the "King" of Veloria was purely symbolic, while the Senate held full authority.

The Trade Wars (4050-4125 AS)

As Veloria’s merchant fleet grew, conflicts with the Garakhese Empire and Destrog led to naval skirmishes and economic sabotage. These "wars" were largely fought through blockades, tariffs, and strategic alliances rather than outright battles. Veloria emerged victorious, securing new trade agreements that cemented its role as a global economic powerhouse.

The "Great War" an eight-hundred year long series of wars, involving most countries ended in 4600. The Treaty of Boscombe and the Lurytes Convention created alliances based on certain laws, including limiting how much land near a coast a country can control. After international negotiating, the UKV ceded much of it's Southeastern Coast, which formed the country of Coastal Veloria, rules by it's own seperate senate and council.

Beginning with the foundation of the International Trade Commision in 4612 AS, an effort spearheaded by the Velorian Senate, Veloria became a key player in establishing the framework for international trade law, ensuring that major trading routes remained open and piracy was contained.

By 4650 AS, with the Maritime Expansion Act, the UKV restructured its navy into a trade-protection fleet, ensuring that its merchant vessels remained secure while reducing military tensions with other nations.

**Rise of the Merchant Lords**

In 4730, wealthy trade families began consolidating political power.

In 4848 AS, a series of violent uprisings erupted across Veloria, particularly in the industrial districts, as grain exports soared while domestic food shortages plagued the lower classes.

In 4850, cutting costs, the Merchant lords vetoed the renewal of the Maritime Expansion Act

In 4855 AS, The aftermath of the riots led to the First Economic Reform Act, which introduced minimum wage laws, worker protections, and subsidies for local industry. However, these changes were largely resisted by the Merchant Lords, and disbanded in the year 4890. 

This culminated in the Labor Revolts of 4899. These revolts lasted for five years until the Second Economic Reform Act, which was fully implimented by 4915, established clearer limits on private monopolies and introduced social welfare programs, easing tensions but failing to fully resolve economic inequality.

4912 AS, the Gnome-Killing Pestilence wiped out most of gnome-kind across the world in a matter of weeks.

Further discontentment, and the textile fires of 5130 led to the Third Economic Reform Act, by 5145.

Anti-slavery laws were passed in 5234.

**Language**: Velorian - Closely tied with the international trade language Neroshi, Velorian was a criole language formed by the many refuges from across Varethis.
