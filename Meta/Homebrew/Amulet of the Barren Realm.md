**Properties:**  
The Amulet of the Barren Realm grants each attuned wearer access to a unique, personal plane of existence—a barren planet of endless potential, yet devoid of life.

- **Personal Realm:** Upon attuning to the amulet, the wearer gains access to their own distinct Barren Realm it is a lifeless ecosystem, composed of rocks, sand, water, and wind. The density of oxygen is not initially enough to sustain life for more than a few hours at a time, though oxygen can come through an open portal.   

- **Portals of Passage:** As a bonus action, the wearer can open a portal to their Barren Realm. This portal remains open as long as the wearer desires and can be closed at any time as a bonus action. When a portal is open, the amulet remains in the material plane, and the wearer can freely enter and exit the realm. The portal can be created to connect to any location within the Barren Realm, but exiting the realm always returns the wearer to the location of the amulet in the material plane.

- **Realm Vulnerabilities:** The Barren Realm is inherently linked to the amulet. If the amulet is dispelled, damaged, or destroyed, or if another individual attunes to it, the realm collapses, destroying everything within it. If the wearer is inside when this occurs, they die unless they can plane shift out before the collapse completes. Similarly, the amulet can be subjected to an antimagic field or *Counterspell* to prevent the portal from functioning, trapping the wearer within or preventing their entry.

- **Expansive Spellcasting:** Any area of effect spell cast on the amulet extends its effect throughout the entire Barren Realm. By meditating for 1 hour, the wearer can create lists that of entities within the realm, stored in the spell's memory. The wearer can choose whether a spell affects entities on each list. If no lists are defined, the spell affects all entities in the realm equally. This feature can be utilized by an enemy caster if they gain access to the amulet.

- **Magical Material:** Materials within the Barren Realm are magically summoned. These materials can be dispelled, causing them to vanish, unless they are bound with life (e.g., drinking water, growing crops with soil). Binding with life makes the materials permanent.

- **Manipulate Environment:** The attuned wearer can use _Mold Earth_, _Shape Water_, _Gust_, and _Control Flames_ at will, without expending resources, on any summoned material in the realm until it is bound with life.

- **Shared Realm:** The wearer can allow others to enter the Barren Realm.

- **Plane Shift Capability:** Once the wearer has visited their Barren Realm, they gain the ability to use *Plane Shift* to return to it from the material plane.

**Attunement:**  
Attuning to the Amulet of the Barren Realm requires an hour of solitary meditation.
