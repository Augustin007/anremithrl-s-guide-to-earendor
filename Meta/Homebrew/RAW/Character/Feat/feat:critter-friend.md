*Prerequisite: Gnome (forest)*
Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:
* You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you’re already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.
* You learn the Speak with Animals spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the Animal Friendship spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
