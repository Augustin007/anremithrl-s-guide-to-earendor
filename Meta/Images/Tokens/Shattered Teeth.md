Long before the Sundering, when mortals first began to walk the earth, and history was first being writ. Even as the Taur en Faroth was being founded a continent away, the realm of Hathros was first being settled and inhabited. 

There was much unrest between those who dwelt in Hathros, and there were many cities ruled by many peoples, and between them there were many wars. 

And in this region there dwelt a dwarf named Calbarum, and he was a farmer, and a man of strength. He was descended from Andaius, who had been a prince of Daran, which had sunk beneath the waves, and his grandfather was Andaius's son. 

Now Calbarum was a noble man, and he stood in defense of his city many times. But he was wearied by the constant war. His people first fled their city, raising a new city, hidden in the deep great mountains, this city was called Mycenae.

Calbarum wished for peace between the cities, and he would often leave his hidden nation and advocate for it, but he would not live to see this peace.

It was said that Thadred had feared Calbarum while he was alive, for shortly after his death it was that Thadred raised an army, and began conquering the region.

Anamos was a mortal of Mycenae who spoke with gods, and he was a friend of Varian, the Celestial, who came to the mortal plane often from Arvandor. Together, the two inspired much hope, and they led forces against Thadred, and when all was said and done, there was a vast region which pledged themselves to Anamos and Varian, and the people called themselves the Anami.

Now Anamos was mortal, but from then on Varian ruled the country of Thalassos, and he chose regents to rule whenever he left.

Then it was that the Elessar Caellus, he who brought the sun and moon into the sky, descended from Arvandor, and he took abode in the region, and he dwelt in the country of Thalassos, in the city of Thara, and his followers flocked there, and brought it much prosperity.

Further in the south the country of Eldorath was founded by those who were displeased with Varian's rule. They pledged themselves to Nebelum and accumulated knowledge. They housed a great library, known in the land.

And from the tips of the iron hills were the Dravaran, who lived around a great lake and in the forests, these were the remnant of those who were conquered by Thadred.

Now, in the valley known as Echoriath, right at the border of the Dravaran and the Thalassos, there were burgeons of ancient magic, remnants from Azgorath's capture, and it fell to the Ring of Varian, a circle of his highest followers, to re-cast there the bindings that held Azgorath in place.

The country of Thalassos was filled with dams and roads and bridges. It had armies and navies, and it was the largest of the countries of old.

---
Now in this region lived Magnar Rilion. He was an elf of the Dravaran. And he was greatly generous, despite living in the poverty of Dravaran, and he lived near Echoriath, and the magic of it clung to him. And he became a sorcerer of great power. He could not reign in his magic, and it would explode out of him. He sought the help of the gods, and the council of Arvandor gave him a blessing, and he became the first mortal dragon, and he had now control over his powers. 

And when Tar-Nakthos came into power, and enacted great cruelties, he killed the tyrant and became known as Tar-Rilion, and was known as a good king.

His descendents were his sons Tal'berius and Artorius and his daughter Nanor and the draconic magic had faded little between generations, though there form only had the slightest draconic aspect. 

Now Tal'berius and Artorius were the elder, and they were devoted to learning, and they were strong in magic and learning. and among other things, they compiled the Codex Arcanum. They studied under the greatest minds of the age.

Nanor was born only a year before the sundering.

---

Now, when the betrayer gods first struck at mortals, they struck Thalassos, for Varian had spoken against the unmaking of mortals, and Azmodeus wished for revenge, and not a mortal in there had time to react or call for help. No alarm was raised. Few of the Anami lived past that day. And the regent, named Anamos, the fourth regent of that name, lay dead on the battlements of Mycenae.

And Varian, came down and saw his people killed and he was incensed, and would have fought Tharizdun on the spot, but his brother Thalorin advised him to go first to the council, or else they may lose any hope of alliance and peace between the gods.

But the Sundering War began.

And Eldorath fell soon thereafter, and Nebelum, who had until then argued for a peaceful end to the war, was angered then, and left Arvandor and fought alongside Thalorin against the betrayers.

But the borders of the Dravaran were protected at first by the great magics of their king.

They harbored survivors for some time, and their people fought against the betrayers, and Tal'berius and Artorius fought bravely in the war, becoming known as an unstoppable duo of forces. 

Tharizdun railed against the wards of Tar-Rilion, and though he could not pass them, his creations could, and a great plague swept the land, and young Nanor, still but a child, fell ill and died. Rillion, consumed by anger and grief, then flew to meet Tharizdun in battle and was slain, and the wards fell. 

His two sons rushed back to protect their kingdom and avenge their father and sister. They challenged Tharizdun in the valley of Echoriath, and they held him back. For eight hours they fought, and in the eighth hour Artorius sacrificed himself to save his brother, and as Tharizdun gloated, Tal'berius struck deep into Tharizdun's heart, imbuing his grief over the deaths of his brother and his sister and his father into a work of magic so powerful it undid the bindings that kept Azgorath chained and opened a rift into Pandemonium itself, the realm outside of time and space where the Queen of Chaos dwells.

Tal'berius carved out the heart of Tharizdun for himself, and as the god still lived, Tal'berius dragged him down to the nine hells and chained him with his own chains. He contained the rift into Chaos in an orb made of glass forged in Order, and hid it deep in a dungeon of his own construction, and Tal'berius retreated from the world of mortals for a long time.

Though the rift was gone, the bindings of the world were made loose, and great amount of chaotic energies transformed the region, and war between the gods scattered the people.

Varian was long gone, and the library of Eldorath was no more. Those who remained were scattered far and wide across the region. And it was impassable and difficult to survive there. It became filled with deep ravines, jagged mountains, and winding rivers. Few places had fertile land and many animals had died. Storms of pure chaos were common and dangerous. The survivors faced an impassable and inhospitable environment. The place became known as the shattered teeth.

With cities no longer tenable, people grouped together into nomadic tribes, each striving for survival in a harsh and unpredictable world. The remnants of the once-great civilizations now wandered, scavenging for resources and moving frequently to find sustenance.

In the centuries following the Sundering, the tribes of the Shattered Teeth adapted to their environment. They developed new ways of living, relying on their knowledge of the land and the remnants of ancient magic. Fertile land was scarce, so agriculture was limited. Instead, they turned to hunting, gathering, and scavenging.

Despite the chaos, the tribes managed to preserve aspects of their cultural heritage. Oral traditions and storytelling became vital in maintaining their history and identity. Artisans continued to create, and warriors passed down their skills to new generations. The spirit of the old civilizations lived on through these efforts.

Among these tribes, a tribe formed of some of the remnants of the Anami, were led by a man named Sorian. Sorian remembered the great universities and libraries that once existed. He remembered the library of Eldorath and the great works of magic. They came to the ruins of Mycenae and rebuilt what they could, and they were lucky, for the land there was still somewhat fertile, and they were the first to build again cities.

Sorian then founded an order devoted to recovering of pre-sundering magic and knowledge. He traded many goods, tools, and food in exchange for scavenged items. Deep in the mines he constructed a great vault, and insulated it against what magic he could. After his death, Eledor headed the order after Sorian's death, and they became known as the Cobalt order, for the vast mines of Cobalt.

Now, the tribes fought often among each other over their many resources. Vorrak was the leader of a tribe consisting of seventy-two men, soldiers who had fought in the Sundered War. They hoarded weapons and aided tribes in exchange for resources. They took captives, and married into other tribes to form alliances. They became known as the Vorokai.

Thalen was the leader of the Rassac, who were also remnants of the Amani. They allied themselves with the Vorokai, but they dealt in poisons and stealth tactics. 

But Shar's tendrils reached the world, and her abberations attacked the regions, and the tribes grew fearful.

Thalen, the great grandson of the first Thalen, lead a great alliance meeting in the valley of Echoriath, and many tribes came together, and swore themselves to Duren, the leader of the Vorokai.

The Vorokai conquered the lands around them for many miles, and founded the Kesnan Kingdom. 

The Aenari tribe emerged from the survivors of the Dravaran. They were known for their exceptional skills in navigation and sailing, as they lived along the fragmented coastline. The Aenari built small, fast ships that could navigate the treacherous waters of the Shattered Teeth. They established the Aenari Confederation, a collection of city-states bound by trade and mutual defense pacts. Their capital, Aenara, became a bustling port and a hub of commerce.

The Vossari were renowned for their craftsmanship, producing some of the finest weapons and armor in the region.

This northern region was settled by the Nevad people, known for their resilience and tenacity. Nevad was a land of harsh winters and rugged terrain, and its people adapted to survive in this challenging environment. They developed advanced techniques in ice magic and became skilled hunters and warriors. Their capital, Kylithar, was a fortress city built into the mountains, providing both defense and shelter from the elements.

Heirh was a coastal region known for its skilled sailors and fishermen. The Heirhians developed advanced seafaring technology and established a strong maritime trade network.

Vedra was a central region known for its strategic location and military strength. The Vedrans were fierce warriors who valued honor and combat prowess. They built a formidable army and established the capital, Vedrath, as a military stronghold. Vedra played a crucial role in defending against external threats and maintaining stability within the Shattered Teeth. The Vedrans were also known for their martial arts and battle tactics.

Morrichrim was a land of deep forests and ancient magic. The Morrichrim people were known for their connection to nature and their druidic traditions. They lived in harmony with the land, practicing rituals and ceremonies to honor the natural world. Their capital, Morrichra, was hidden deep within the forest, protected by powerful enchantments. The Morrichrim were skilled in herbalism and natural magic, and their society was deeply spiritual.

Gorndorach was a mountainous region known for its rich mineral deposits. The Gorndorachians were skilled miners and blacksmiths, producing some of the finest weapons and tools in the region.

Over time, the Cobalt Order, now known as Cyddartiame, grew in influence and power, their ambitions expanding far beyond the mere preservation of knowledge. They hoarded their knowledge jealously, their vaults filled with artifacts and tomes from before the Sundering. Few outside the Order knew anything about what was stored within these subterranean chambers, shrouded in secrecy and protected by formidable enchantments.

The leaders of Cyddartiame, known as the Magisters, paid great amounts of money to obtain the rarest and most powerful magical items. Their network of spies and informants stretched across the shattered lands, seeking out relics and ancient texts. They would stop at nothing to acquire what they sought, using both wealth and subterfuge to achieve their ends.

Realizing the importance of securing their troves of knowledge, Cyddartiame gradually conquered the surrounding region to create a formidable bastion around their precious vault. The city of Cydaris, nestled deep within the cobalt-rich mountains, became an impregnable fortress. Its walls were reinforced with both physical and magical defenses, and its watchtowers were manned by the most elite soldiers in the land.

The guards of the vault, known as the Sentinels, were the most skilled warriors and mages the Order could produce. They were fanatically loyal and would kill without warning to protect the vault. Each Sentinel underwent rigorous training and enchantments to ensure their effectiveness in combat and their unwavering dedication to their duty. The magical protections surrounding the vault were deep and complex, crafted by the most talented sorcerers of the Order. 

As Cyddartiame's power grew, so did its reputation for secrecy and ruthlessness. The Order's Magisters rarely appeared in public, preferring to operate from the shadows. Their decrees were carried out by intermediaries, and their true motives were known only to a select few. This veil of secrecy fostered an aura of mystique and fear, deterring potential adversaries.

Now, in those times, there were a great many monsters that roamed the world. 

The Kesnan Kingdom, under the leadership of the Vorokai, emerged as one of the most powerful entities in the Shattered Teeth. Duren, the first king, led his people with strength and cunning, expanding the kingdom's territory and solidifying its influence. The Kesnan Kingdom became a beacon of stability, attracting refugees and smaller tribes who sought protection from the chaos. The Vorokai's martial prowess and strategic marriages further strengthened the kingdom's power. From them create great heroes, like Marik and Eamas and Kelras, who drove away monsters. They had a long alliance with the Vossari.

The Vossari Dominion, nestled in the northern mountains, became renowned for its mining and metallurgy. The Vossari clans, united under a common banner, transformed their capital, Vossar, into a fortress city of unparalleled strength. The Vossari's craftsmanship in weapons and armor was unmatched, and their engineers constructed impressive fortifications and machinery. Their alliance with the Kesnan Kingdom ensured mutual defense and economic prosperity.

In the land of Heth, nestled between the fractured peaks and winding rivers of the Shattered Teeth, lived a man named Eldan. Born into a humble family of fishermen and farmers, Eldan's early years were spent in the shadow of Heth's coastal cliffs, where the roar of the ocean met the whispers of ancient forests. Despite the hardships of living in a land scarred by chaos and war, the people of Heth were resilient, finding solace in their traditions and the natural beauty that surrounded them.

From a young age, Eldan was captivated by the stories of old, tales of the great library of Eldorath and the knowledge it once housed. His parents, proud of their descent from Eldorath, named him after the fabled city. They often shared with him the legends of Nebelum, the patron god of Eldorath, who valued wisdom and peace. Eldan's curiosity grew into an obsession as he sought to learn all he could about the lost knowledge and the god who had inspired it.

As Eldan grew, he spent more time studying history and the ancient texts that had survived the Sundering. His passion for learning led him to the village priest, who recognized the boy's fervor and began teaching him the ways of Nebelum. Eldan's dedication was unparalleled, and he soon became the priest's most promising disciple.

The storms of chaos had been growing incredibly powerful in this time, and one of these destroyed many homes and crops. Eldan, now a young man, stepped forward to lead the recovery efforts. His calm demeanor and unwavering faith in Nebelum inspired those around him. 

The devotion spread throughout the western part of the Shattered Teeth, and shrines for Nebelum soon became very popular.

He spoke against the Cobalt Order and their secrecy, and they hated him in return. In the dead of night, hired Rassac assassins killed Eldan and his family and set fire to his village.

Countries changed over time, borders shifted over the course of many wars.

The seeds of the Thousand-Year War were sown in the quiet shadows and whispered intrigues of Cyddartiame. As the Magisters of Cyddartiame grew bolder in their ambitions, their desire for dominion clashed with the steadfast resolve of the Kesnan Kingdom. The Kesnan rulers, descended from Duren and the Vorokai, valued their independence and were determined to protect their people from the insidious reach of the Cobalt Order.

Tensions between Cyddartiame and the Kesnan Kingdom had simmered for centuries. The Magisters, masters of subterfuge and manipulation, had long used their network of spies to destabilize their enemies. The Kesnan Kingdom, however, had grown resilient and vigilant, often thwarting Cyddartiame's covert operations.

The war's catalyst came when Cyddartiame's agents orchestrated the assassination of King Bormik, a beloved Kesnan ruler known for his wisdom and strength. The assassination was meant to plunge the Kesnan Kingdom into chaos, but instead, it galvanized the Kesnan people. Bormik's son, Prince Eldak, ascended to the throne, vowing to bring the Magisters to justice and end their shadowy reign.

The early years of the war were marked by skirmishes and small-scale battles. While the Kesnan kingdom had the advantage of a long martial tradition. the Magisters, wielding ancient and powerful magic, unleashed devastating arcane attacks on Kesnan strongholds.

As the war dragged on, it became a grueling war of attrition. Both sides suffered tremendous losses, and neither could gain a decisive advantage. The Kesnan Kingdom fortified its defenses, building massive walls and underground bunkers to protect its cities. Cyddartiame, in turn, fortified its mountainous stronghold, Cydaris, with layers of enchantments and traps.

The conflict spilled into every aspect of life in the Shattered Teeth. Trade routes were disrupted, causing widespread famine and economic hardship. Tribes and smaller nations were forced to choose sides or face annihilation. The Triumvirate Alliance fractured as internal conflicts arose, with some members choosing to ally with Cyddartiame, drawn by promises of power and protection.

One of the war's most significant battles occurred at Pyrfan Keep, a crucial Kesnan fortress guarding a vital mountain pass. Cyddartiame launched a massive assault, hoping to break through and strike at the heart of the Kesnan Kingdom. The defenders, led by General Lothas, held out for months under relentless siege, allowing Cyddartiame to spend their strength against them. In the end he drove them away, resulting in a costly victory for the Kesnans.

In the 500th year of the war, the Kesnan Kingdom launched a bold offensive against Cydaris itself. Led by Queen Aria, a direct descendant of Edrin, the Kesnan forces managed to breach the outer defenses of the city. The Siege of Cydaris lasted for three years, with both sides suffering catastrophic losses. The storms of Chaos grew to great, and the Kesnans were forced to retreat, unable to overcome the formidable enchantments protecting the city.

The war was often interrupted by great storms of chaos, and by truces that lasted for long amounts of time.

As the war approached its millennium mark, both sides were exhausted. The Kesnan Kingdom, though battered, remained unbroken. Cyddartiame, despite its powerful magic, struggled to maintain control over its vast network of spies and agents.

After King Duren XIV's death, Malachar, the Grand Magistier brokered a peace treaty with his successor Varnak. They ended the war, both weak and battered from a millenium of constant fighting.

In this time, King Eldan II of the Vossari, named after Eldan of Heth, known as Eldan Bauglak, united many countries in a great alliance. He saw the two countries as weakened, and thought that he could conquer them both. He broke his alliance with Kesna and attacked them first, and then Cyddartiame. This caused the great alliance between Kesna and Cyddartiame. Together they defeated Bauglak.

Seeing benefit in this alliance, and desiring peace, Varnak forged the great alliance with the Cyddartiame during this time. And they supported each other during several conflicts.

Eighteen years ago, to ensure stability within the Shattered Teeth and strengthen alliances, there was formed the Council of Unity. This council included representatives from most major nations, such as Aenari Confederation, the Kesnan kingdom, the Vossari Dominion, and Cyddartiame. The Council of Unity served as a forum for diplomatic negotiations, conflict resolution, and collaborative efforts to address common challenges, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation among the diverse peoples of the Shattered Teeth.

Twelve years ago, Queen Iselda III, daughter of Duren XVIII, ascended to the throne of the Kesnan Kingdom. She married a general named Eldan Torvik. Since her rise to power, there have been rumours that she caused her father's and her older sister's sudden illnesses. Though propaganda in the region lauded her for her wisdom, strategic acumen, and unwavering dedication to her people, Queen Iselda's reign has marked a time of despair for the Kesnan Kingdom. Though popular by many of the more warlike clans among the Vorokai nobility for her ruthlessness, her rule has been harsh and difficult for all. She is known to cause 'accidents' for people who oppose her and maintains an iron grip on the country. 

Eleven years ago, Queen Iselda initiated the silver hand initiative. While ostensibly, it exists to revitalise the economy and foster advancements in various fields, its purpose is to build a network of informants and enforcers and spread propaganda. 

Ten years ago, a mysterious plague swept through the Shattered Teeth, originating from the chaotic remnants of the Sundering. The Plague of Shadows caused widespread devastation, particularly in the southern regions. The plague of Shadows lasted for three years before a cure was found by doctors in Vedia. Though it has been eradicated in most of the Shattered Teeth, the cure has not reached all parts of the Kesnan Kingdom.

Eight years ago, the Cherhal empire invaded the Shattered Teeth from the south, striking at Kesnan territory. The war lasted five years, and in the end Cherhal was granted land in the southern tip of the Shattered Teeth by the peace treaty three years ago.
