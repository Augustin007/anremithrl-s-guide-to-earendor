*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*
The pages of this book are bound in fiend hide, and its cover is embossed with a diagram of the Great Wheel of the multiverse. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[spell:banishment|banishment]], [[spell:find-familiar|find familiar]], [[Meta/RAW/Character/Extra_Abilities/Spells/spell:Gate|gate]], [[spell:magic-circle|magic circle]], [[spell:planar-binding|planar binding]], and [[spell:summon-elemental|summon elemental]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.
While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:
* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.
* When you cast a conjuration spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.
