***You spent a significant amount of time somewhere influenced by a portal to another plane of existence or by intense planar forces. You’re accustomed to experiences that would leave others reeling in terror or enraptured by otherworldly beauty, and you’re as comfortable dealing with fiends and celestials as you are with vendors in town.***

Planar Infusion
Living someplace steeped in the energy of the planes, you gain the [[feat:scion-of-the-outer-planes-ua|scion of the outer planes]] feat. In addition, you know where to find free, modest lodging and food in the community you grew up in.
Building a Gate Warden Character
================================
Those who dwell for any extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. This creates similarities in behaviors and even physical appearances that mark someone as influenced by a particular plane.
***Suggested Characteristics.*** The influence of an Outer Plane shapes your perspective. The Gate Warden Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.
Gate Warden Personality Traits
| d6 | Personality Trait |
| 1 | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don’t phase me. |
| 2 | I think in terms of exchange; something for something, nothing for nothing. |
| 3 | I speak with an unusual cadence. |
| 4 | I pepper my speech with borrowed words or curses from planar languages. |
| 5 | I’ve seen enough to know that you can’t take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone I deal with. |
| 6 | I have a superstitious habit I picked up, such as touching iron when I’m nervous or arranging objects in a specific order. |
***Gate Warden Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the Gate Warden Trinkets table, instead of on the [[trinkets|trinkets]] table in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.

| 1 | A tiny vial pendant, filled with a drip of honey that glows faintly |
| 2 | A small lead ingot with a strange thumbprint pressed into it that whispers when held tightly |
| 3 | Two lodestone spheres that chime when they attract each other |
| 4 | A smoldering pebble of coal that, while always hot, doesn’t burn skin |
| 5 | A white feather that sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius |
| 6 | A ring made from a chain link that, once worn, won’t come off without pulling painfully hard |
