Giant Foundling Personality Traits
***Though you aren’t a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.***
***Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you through childhood, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—ensured that you grew to a remarkable size. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the titanic might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.***

Giant Foundling Personality Traits
| d6 | Personality Trait |
| 1 | What I lack in stature, I make up for with sheer spite. |
| 2 | Sometimes size does matter, okay? If I see a beast bigger than me, I’m immediately running away. |
| 3 | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I’d much rather be in a wide-open field than a bustling tavern. |
| 4 | I like being small. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated. |
| 5 | Size is just half the story. Every avalanche begins as a single pebble. |
| 6 | The world always feels too big, and I’m afraid I’ll never find my place in it. |
