***The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist - the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways - attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress.***

Rubblebelt Refuge
You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.
Gruul Guild Spells
*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*
For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)
**Gruul Guild Spells**
| Spell Level | Spell |
| Cantrip | [[spell:fire-bolt|fire bolt]], [[spell:produce-flame|produce flame]] |
| 1st | [[spell:compelled-duel|compelled duel]], [[spell:speak-with-animals|speak with animals]], [[spell:thunderwave|thunderwave]] |

Fueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands.
Suggested Characteristics
=========================
Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.

Contacts
========
The members of the Gruul Clans rely on each other even as they vie for territory and glory. Their encounters with members of other guilds are more often violent than friendly, but occasional bonds do form.
Roll twice on the Gruul Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Gruul Contacts table.
