Factions of Sigil
=================
Twelve Factions have risen to prominence in the City of Doors, though many more exist. Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation.  
The primary factions of Sigil adhere to the following philosophies:
**Athar.** Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.  
**Bleak Cabal.** There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.  
**Doomguard.** Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.  
**Fated.** Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.  
**Fraternity of Order.** All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.  
**Hands of Havoc.** Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.  
**Harmonium.** The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is in harmony, whether it wants to or not.  
**Heralds of Dust.** Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.  
**Mercykillers.** Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.  
**Mind's Eye.** The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.  
**Society of Sensation.** Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.  
**Transcendent Order.** Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.

Building a Planar Philosopher Character
=======================================
Some groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks.
***Suggested Characteristics.***  
Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.
