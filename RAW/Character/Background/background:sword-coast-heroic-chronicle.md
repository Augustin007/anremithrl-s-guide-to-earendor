Backstory
=========
A character's story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.
Homelands
The Sword Coast and the North can be divided into five major political regions, each of which are described in chapter 2 of the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide. These regions are the Lords’ Alliance, the Dwarfholds of the North, the Island Kingdoms, Independent Realms, and the Underdark.
To determine your homeland, roll 1d100 on the Homelands table below. You may decide your character was born in one region but grew up in another. In that case, roll twice to determine the land of your birth and the land you were ultimately raised in.
| Homelands |
| d100 | Region (Government) |
| 01-50 | Lords' Alliance |
| 51-60 | Dwarfholds of the North |
| 61-70 | Island Kingdoms |
| 71-95 | Independent Realms |
| 96-00 | Underdark |
Background
In addition to granting you items, gold, and proficiencies, your background gives you a sense of belonging in the world.

Social Status
Even in lands as free as the Sword Coast and the North, most folk are trapped in their social station by forces they can’t control like wealth, family, and political power. Your story begins with you as a member of one social class, determined by your homeland and your background.

Acquired Allies and Rivals
If you gained allies or rivals based on your background and your homeland, this section allows you to establish your relationship with those allies and rivals, as well as the broad strokes of their identities.
| d100 | Ally | Rival |
| 01-10 | This ally is a loyal pet. Rather than rolling on the Ally and Rival Identities table, choose one beast of CR 1/8 or lower as your pet. | This person believes you murdered their sibling. Regardless of your guilt or innocence, they are out for your blood. |
| 11-20 | This person once lost a bet to you and is still trying to scrounge up the cash to pay you back. They've decided you'd both be better off if they put you in their debt instead. | You bested this person in combat, but they believe you cheated to defeat them. They long to prove that they are the superior warrior. |
| 21-30 | This person was once a beggar to whom you gave a large sum of money. They have transformed their life thank to you, and now want to repay your generosity. | You broke a promise to this person, and it caused them to suffer greatly. Now they conspire to make someone else break a valuable promise to you. |
| 31-40 | You were this persons' favorite drinking buddy, and their home is always open to you and your friends. | You once loved this person, but broke their heart. They are now obsessed with making you feel the same pain they felt. |
| 41-50 | This person was once your mentor, but you left before you could complete your training. You are welcome to return and finish what you started, but only when you are ready. | This person was ordered to arrest you, and doggedly hunts you wherever you go. |
| 51-60 | You bonded with this person over a traumatic event such as a battle or an armed robbery. If you ever tell them that you are in danger, they will try to aid you. | This person thinks that you were replaced by a doppelganger or possessed by a spirit or monster. They are now trying to defeat you, so as to find or free the original you. |
| 61-70 | You and this person share a terrible secret, and you have sworn to never reveal it to anyone. They will help you keep this secret if it is ever in danger of being revealed. | You fled from your home under mysterious circumstances. This person is obsessed with finding out the truth of what caused you to leave. |
| 71-80 | This person fell in love with you. If you reciprocated, they always stand at your side. If you didn't, they took it well, and still consider you their closest friend. | You and this person tried to harness power beyond your control, and it left them disfigured and in constant pain. Having since mastered the power that nearly destroyed them, they now seek to turn it upon you. |
| 81-90 | You and this person were affected by powerful magic, and now you both share a telepathic connection that functions while you are within 1 miles of each other. | You helped this person out once when they were down on their luck, and now they go to you whenever they need help. |
| 91-00 | This person owes you their life. Even if they can't follow you everywhere you go, they will do anything they can to protect you. | This person wants to be your friend, but their help has always made your life harder. |
Ally and Rival Identities
When you've determined the relationships between you and your acquired allies and rivals, roll for each one on the Ally and Rival Identities table to determine their game statistics. This table includes monsters and NPCs in this book and in the *Monster Manual.*
If you roll a particularly powerful ally or rival on this table, their involvement in your life causes a fateful moment to occur in your backstory, as determined on the Fateful Moments table.

Fateful Moments
No one decides to go adventuring without a reason. Some might set out from home in the name of vengeance, seeking retribution for themselves or their kin. Some might be looking for wealth or glory. Others might seek only a change from their dreary lives, never realizing that they'll soon be caught up in events beyond their understanding along the open road.
Roll once on the Fateful Moments table for each such moment you accrued in the previous section, courtesy of the allies and rivals that are part of your backstory.
| Fateful Moments |
| d20 | Event |
| 1 | Your mother or father disappeared in the night, leaving behind a note and a package. The note read, “I’m sorry—there is a duty I am sworn to do. You must protect yourself and family while I am gone.” The package was a **+1 longsword** wrapped in a quilted blanket. You have proficiency with longswords. |
| 2 | You were lost in the wilderness when a terrible storm nearly killed you. When you awoke, you were gravely wounded, but felt a strange power within you. You have the Elemental Adept feat from the Player’s Handbook and the ability to cast a cantrip based on the type of storm you were in. Constitution is your spellcasting modifier for this cantrip. Acid rain ([[spell:acid-splash|acid splash]]), snowstorm ([[spell:ray-of-frost|ray of frost]]), forest fire ([[spell:produce-flame|produce flame]]), lightning storm ([[spell:shocking-grasp|shocking grasp]]), thunderstorm ([[spell:booming-blade|booming blade]]). |
| 3 | The fell voice of the archdevil Zariel spoke to you in a dream. You no longer remember what that voice said, or what you promised to give it in return, but now you can cast [[spell:find-familiar|find familiar]] as a ritual. Your familiar always takes the form of an imp. You also have a random form of indefinite madness, determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. |
| 4 | You tumbled off a cliff and suffered a fall that should have killed you. When you awoke, you saw a figure that you believed to be the goddess Mystra in the distance through your bleary vision. You now occasionally hear her voice in your dreams, telling you strange secrets about the Weave. You have proficiency in the Arcana and Religion skills. |
| 5 | You found a massive footprint while exploring the wilderness. Looking closer, you discovered a runestone smashed into the ground within the print. You touched it, and felt power surge within you as you grew to tremendous size! You shrunk moments later, but can still feel the power within you. You can cast [[spell:enlarge-reduce|enlarge/reduce]] once per day, using the enlarge option only. |
| 6 | A horde of terrible monsters attacked your home, either destroying it (village/town) or doing massive damage before being repulsed (city/fortress). You will never forget the images of wanton slaughter that you saw. You have the [[feat:alert|alert]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook.* |
| 7 | You ventured too deep into a local hill-barrow without sufficient gear and fell through a false floor. You landed in a deep dungeon, and survived in the monster-infested darkness there for years before you managed to escape. You are haunted by what you experienced, but you learned much about how to survive in such a place. You have the [[feat:dungeon-delver|dungeon delver]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook.* |
| 8 | You were captured by drow or duergar in a raid. You managed to escape slavery, but had to disguise yourself and pretend to be one of them to survive on the streets without being captured again. Eventually, you made your escape. You gain the [[feat:actor|actor]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook* and proficiency with disguise kits. |
| 9 | Your family unknowingly gave shelter to a member of the Cult of the Dragon, and unwittingly earned their favor. The cult believes you are one of them, and gave you 1,000 gp to deliver to a secret shrine to Tiamat, along with a map to that shrine. |
| 10 | A master horse trainer came to your home one day, seeking refuge from a warlord who had purchased his horses and then sought to kill him to keep his secrets from spreading. He rewarded you by mentoring you as a horse trainer. You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill, and a warhorse with full tack and harness. |
| 11 | A Red Wizard of Thay tortured your family to death before your very eyes, and in a fit of blind rage you killed the cruel wizard with a skewer from your fireplace. You have the [[feat:mage-slayer|mage slayer]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook.* |
| 12 | While traveling, you found an elf of Evereska at the side of the road, their chest pierced by manticore spines. They begged you for help, and showed you the gestures to cast a spell of healing. You nearly collapsed from the exertion, but managed to cast the spell. You gain the [[feat:magic-initiate|magic initiate]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook*, learning two bard, cleric, or druid cantrips and the [[spell:cure-wounds|cure wounds]] spell. |
| 13 | You were trained in the art of combat by an old traveling warrior. He saved your village from bandits while you were training together, but died in the process. You inherited his weapon and his techniques. You have proficiency with a martial weapon of your choice, and you own one such weapon. It has special features as detailed in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. You also have the [[feat:martial-adept|martial adept]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook.* |
| 14 | You were saved from a cult of the Dead Three by a member of the Flaming Fist mercenary company. Their sergeant was an inspiring and charismatic half-orc, and you can still hear her words in your head. You have the [[feat:inspiring-leader|inspiring leader]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook.* |
| 15 | Your village was burned to the ground by raiders. This band of marauders was led by a being whose image has been seared into your mind forever. Roll on the Rivals and Allies Identities table to determine what type of creature their leader was. You have proficiency in the Stealth and Survival skills. |
| 16 | You fell asleep in a forest and awakened in the court of the fey, where you were made to serve the fickle Archfey for a decade. When you finally managed to escape, it was as if no time had passed. You have proficiency with the Deception and Performance skills. |
| 17 | A majestic phoenix with wings of flame flew over your home one day, but when you asked other people about it, you learned that you were the only one who saw it. You’ve started having dreams about the fiery bird, and discovered you can manifest its flames. As a bonus action, you can ignite your fists or a weapon you’re holding in flames for 1 minute, causing those attacks to deal fire damage instead of its usual damage. Starting at 5th level, the attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest. |
| 18 | A skilled dwarven armorer traveled through your home settlement one day, and held a blacksmithing contest. You impressed him, and he taught you the secret of how to make armor from adamantine, the hardest material on Faerûn. You have a suit of adamantine armor in a style of your choice. |
| 19 | You were imprisoned for a grave crime you didn’t commit—or possibly one you did. When you got out of prison, you picked up a number of habits from your inmates. You have proficiency in the Intimidation or Deception skill (your choice) and you know thieves’ cant. |
| 20 | You were an apprentice at the grand library of Candlekeep, where you learned secrets beyond most mortals’ knowledge. You gain the [[feat:skilled|skilled]] feat from the *Player’s Handbook*, and can work with your Dungeon Master to create a secret that could change the fate of the world. |
Mysterious Secret
You saw something you weren't supposed to. A note came into your possession by mysterious means. You can roll on the Mysterious Secrets table or work with your DM to create a secret.
| Mysterious Secrets |
| d20 | Secret |
| 1 | While traveling through Elturgard, I had a waking vision that the Companion which glows above Elturel was eclipsed and began to sink into the ground. |
| 2 | An agent of the Lords’ Alliance once begged my mother to “reconsider their offer,” but she spat in her face and said “that’s what I think of your offer!” I’ve seen strange people watching her ever since. |
| 3 | I remember growing up in a dank and dismal town of pirates called Skullport. My family escaped when I was a child, and we had to leave something very valuable behind. I’ve been trying to get back there ever since. |
| 4 | I discovered a passage to the Underdark that no one knows about while exploring in the woods. I see it in my dreams on strange nights—worse, I sometimes see things coming out of it, or climbing into it. |
| 5 | While sleeping in an inn in Waterdeep, I overheard a conversation through my window about a gold dragon living somewhere beneath the city. That can’t be right, though—the dragonward keeps all dragons out of Waterdeep. |
| 6 | A cleric of Tyr once sheltered in my home for the night. My parents let him stay. When I awoke, he was gone—and when I asked my parents when he had left, no one remembered his arrival. |
| 7 | I met a priest of Myrkul once on the streets of Baldur’s Gate. I was quickly pulled away, but not before she cackled and pointed at me, saying, “In time, the curse of death will claim you. It will claim everything!” |
| 8 | I stole from a beautiful Waterdhavian nobleman as a child, and later discovered that among the things I stole was his signet ring. I’ve seen wanted posters seeking the thief my entire life. |
| 9 | I lived for a year in Ten-Towns in Icewind Dale. One day while living there, a wild-eyed man grabbed me by the collar and shook me, demanding that I tell him where to find the Ring of Winter. His friend slapped his hand and told him I wasn’t the one he was looking for, and they quickly vanished down an alley. |
| 10 | One night, I discovered a golden coin with the face of a beautiful lady on one side. In the morning, the face was gone, and a leering, demonic face was there in its place. Whenever I try to get rid of it, I awaken with it in my pocket. |
| 11 | I was given a card from a mysterious street performer. It’s in black and white with a disturbing illustration. The card is labeled The Executioner. |
| 12 | I was saved from an angry bear as a child when a giant elk leapt in front of me. After it scared the bear off, the elk turned to look at me with such compassion it its eyes, I knew it must be a forest spirit, or even druid in an animal’s form. |
| 13 | I once overheard my parents saying that, when I was born, my father saw a group of drow with a strange Y-shaped mark on their foreheads gazing in through the window. I’ve seen that Y-shaped mark out of the corner of my eye my entire life, always disappearing when I look closely for it. |
| 14 | As a child, I once saw my father meet with a man in full plate armor and a face-covering helm, who called himself Pereghost. When I asked him who that was, he told me he was an old friend and quickly changed the subject. I’ll never forget the look of that armored man. |
| 15 | I have a vague memory that I joined a cult when I was young, and I have a tattoo shaped like the cult’s symbol on my bicep. I can’t remember anything else about it, and my head hurts when I try to remember it. |
| 16 | I was inducted into the Harpers when I was young, and I’ve been spying on the corrupt leaders in my hometown for years. |
| 17 | I found a dragon egg in the forest when I was young. I figure it must be a fake, since it’s never hatched over all these years. But I keep it safe and secret anyway. |
| 18 | While traveling along the Trade Way, I discovered a book from Candlekeep lying in the mud. No one else could see it, and when I opened it, all the pages were blank (save for the mark of Candlekeep on its inner cover). I’ve kept the book, but have never written in it. |
| 19 | I’ve heard the sound of waves crashing in my dreams for the past five years. Recently, they’ve gotten louder, and I can hear a sinister voice quietly speaking in a language I can’t understand underneath the sound of waves. |
| 20 | A paladin in the service of the Order of the Gauntlet killed my uncle for worshiping the evil god Bane. To this day, I don’t know if he truly worshiped dark forces or not. |

Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met - for good or ill.
One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don't have to choose all three goals at the start.
If you're looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn't a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.
