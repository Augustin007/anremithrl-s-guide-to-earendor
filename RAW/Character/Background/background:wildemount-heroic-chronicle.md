Backstory
=========
A character's story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.
Homelands
The known lands of Wildemount are divided into four major geographic regions. From west to eat, these regions are the Menagerie Coast, Western Wynandir (which is further divided into the Marrow Valley and the Zemni Fields), the Greying Wildlands, and Eastern Wynandir. The northernmost reaches of the continent - the forgotten lands of Eiselcross - are not included in this section
| Homelands |
| d100 | Region (Government) |
| 01-21 | Menagerie Coast (choose either the Clovis Concord or Revelry Pirates) |
| 22-40 | Marrow Valley in Western Wynandir (Dwendalian Empire) |
| 41-72 | Zemni Fields in Western Wynandir Dwendalian Empire) |
| 73-77 | Greying Wildlands (choose either the Tribes of Shadycreek Run or Uthodurn) |
| 78-00 | Xhorhas in eastern Wynandir (choose either the Kryn Dynasty or Xarzith Kitril) |
Background
In addition to granting you items, gold, and proficiencies, your background gives you a sense of belonging in the world.

Social Status
Each nation in Wildemount views people's backgrounds according of its cultural values. Based on your character's background, think about your social status within the context of the details of your homeland presented below. Then use the Social Status Relationships table to determine how many allies and rivals you'll roll for later.
### Menagerie Coast
Both the Clovis Concord and their hated nemesis, the Revelry pirates, price personal freedom over all other things. The Revelry simply takes this ideology one bloody step further. People of the Concord celebrate folk heroes and entertainers, and all other people who might become celebrities, iconoclasts, and figures of legend.
At the same time, the common working-class sailor is a symbol of the Concord's strength. As with the crew of a well-run ship, the small actions of individuals can have a huge impact when all are working toward common goals. Common sailors despise the Revelry, and noteworthy sailors might even have a rival within the Revelry.
### Western Wynandir
The Dwendalian Empire prizes king and country over personal freedoms - at least as far as the freedoms of the poor are concerned. For the wealthy noble class, most laws are mere guidelines, since bribery and political favors can make almost any problem go away.
In the Dwendalian Empire, rural folk are seen as honest, hardworking, and pious, while the wealthy ruling class are viewed as beneficent patricians - or as miserly tyrants. Patriotism is a core virtue, and enlisting in the Righteous Brand and adhering to the empire's strict religious laws are the most patriotic acts of all.
### Greying Wildlands
The Greying Wildlands and the settlement of Shadycreek Run are lawless. Crime is a virtue here, mercy a vice. Only strength rules in the land run by the coalition of criminals known as "the Tribes." Anyone who doesn't have the personal strength to defend themselves is treated with contempt, and those who represent the iron fist of the empire are utterly despised.
Travel further north, however, and one reaches the Diarchy of Uthodurn, a stable and ancient city rule by elves and dwarves. Here, order and art are prized over chaos and personal enrichment. If you character is from Uthodurn rather than Shadycreek Run, replace any rival you gain from the Social Status Relationships table with an ally and vice versa.
### Eastern Wynandir
Accumulating knowledge and achieving spiritual enlightenment are the virtues of the Kryn Dynasty, whose society is built around the tenets of the Luxon. Artists, entertainers, artisans, and all people who create are well-valued in Kryn society. yet, in this age of war, people whose skills allow them to destroy are paradoxically prized just as highly.
To the Kryn, a person's background is less important than the experiences they've accumulated - particularly for those who have begun walking the sacred path known as consecution. Nonetheless, even the most enlightened society can't help but look down upon its lowest citizens and sneer at its haughty elite. Once all beings are beloved by the Luxon, perhaps these ills of society will be purged once and for all.

When you've determined the relationships between you and your acquired allies and rivals, roll for each one on the Ally and Rival Identities table to determine their game statistics. This table includes monsters and NPCs in this book and in the *Monster Manual.*

Fateful Moments
No one decides to go adventuring without a reason. Some might set out from home in the name of vengeance, seeking retribution for themselves or their kin. Some might be looking for wealth or glory. Others might seek only a change from their dreary lives, never realizing that they'll soon be caught up in events beyond their understanding along the open road.

You saw something you weren't supposed to. A note came into your possession by mysterious means. You can roll on the Mysterious Secrets table or work with your DM to create a secret.
| Mysterious Secrets |
| d20 | Secret |
| 1 | Years ago my best friend came to me in the middle of the night and gave me a key that glowed with an icy blue light. I never saw that friend again. |
| 2 | I was the only witness to a cold-blooded murder. In the aftermath, I saw the killer take a gold coin with a ruby inlaid at its center from the victim's body. |
| 3 | I once had a dream where an old stranger looked me dead in the eye, screamed "Scourger!" at the top of their lung, and then exploded into a column of flame. |
| 4 | While exploring near my home, I found a cliff with a bunch of caverns dug out of it, all of them large enough for people to hide within. |
| 5 | I once saw a cat that seemed to be moving with a strange sense of purpose. I followed it to the dwelling of an important local elder, where it gazed through the window for an hour. Then it suddenly shook itself and raced away, as though a spell had been broken. |
| 6 | One of my parents left home in the middle of a storm, in the middle of the night. They had their sword and shield. They came back a week later, with the shield practically in pieces. They never talked about that night. |
| 7 | I had a friend who was a farmer. Every week, their crops doubled in size until they had pumpkins as big as houses. Then the next week, the friend was gone and their fields were torched. I never heard from them again. |
| 8 | I once saw an enormous figure walking through the clouds on a stormy night. at one point, they looked at me and kept walking. |
| 9 | I woke up one night to find one of my siblings perched on my chest, staring into my eyes. They said, "The time is soon," and then giggled and ran off. When I asked them, they had no memory of the event. |
| 10 | I once saw a giant bird soar past overhead. It croaked out a cry that sounded like my name, then disappeared beyond the clouds. |
| 11 | I ate a fruit whose seeds spelled out a magic word where I'd cast them onto the ground. Years later, I saw the same word spelled out within a slice of bread. |
| 12 | A warrior friend of mine died. But every so often, I swear I see that friend in their old armor, at the corner of my vision. |
| 13 | An old seer once touched my forehead and gave me a vision of a flaming bird chained beneath a mountain, squirming and wailing in the darkness. |
| 14 | Once while on a boat, I heard a voice rumbling around me. I looked down below the water, and I swear I saw golden eyes looking up at me. |
| 15 | While I was eating, a whole potato exploded into worms, and I suffered a vision of a gigantic worm eating the world like a giant apple. |
| 16 | While picking flowers, I saw a tall figure with red skin and horns wandering the meadow. The flowers grew taller where they walked, but I fled in fear and never saw the figure again. |
| 17 | I was attacked by wolves in the woods one day, and was saved by a stranger with a bandage over their eyes. This person shone with silver light and was covered with scars - and I think I might have seen black wings tucked in at their back. |
| 18 | While trying to forge a sword, I accidentally burned myself with the red-hot blade. A strange vision came to me, of powerful weapons calling out for me to wield them. |
| 19 | I once met someone fleeing through the woods who said they had escaped from some evil place. I asked what that meant, but the stranger fell dead on the spot. When I returned with help to collect the body, it was gone. |
| 20 | I once caught a falling star. It looked up from my hands and smiled, then told me to look for it on the day when fire erupts from the earth. |
Prophecy
Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met - for good or ill.
One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don't have to choose all three goals at the start.
If you're looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn't a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.
| Prophecy Inspirations |
| d20 | Prophecy |
| 1 | I will defeat the creature that killed my parents. Its defeat might make me question my purpose in life. |
| 2 | I will uncover the reason that the Cerberus Assembly took my sibling away. Finding my sibling will set political events beyond my control into motion. |
| 3 | I will save my village from the gnoll tribe that has raided us for the past year. Their defeat will inspire me to perform even greater feats of heroism. |
| 4 | I will unlock the secrets of consecution that the Kryn are hiding. This knowledge will open my mind to a terrifying truth. |
| 5 | I will join a blood hunter order. My new comrades-in-arms will make me powerful, but I must pay a steep price for that power. |
| 6 | I will steal a king's ransom from a Revelry pirate. That wealth will make me happy, but it will also draw unsavory characters to me. |
| 7 | I will become a hero of the war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn. I will be haunted by the atrocities I witness on the battlefield. |
