***This path blends divine devotion and psychic power. The forces tied to the Mind domain teach followers that the mind is the greatest tool and the mightiest weapon in creation. A cleric of the Mind domain learns to harness their own mental power, then uses this gift to protect the faithful and smite enemies.***
***In Eberron, the Mind domain is most associated with the Kalashtar Path of Light and the Riedran Path of Inspiration. However, followers of the cults of the Dragon Below might also follow this path. While visions of Xoriat can certainly drive a priest into madness, they might also reveal deeper secrets and mental powers.***

### Flash of Insight
Starting at 1st level, you can summon power from a well of mental energy at your core. When you make an ability check, you can choose to reroll it after you see the result, but before you know if it succeeds or fails. You get a bonus to this reroll equal to half of your cleric level (minimum of 1).
You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
### Psychic Force
Also at 1st level, you learn to buffet your foes with mental power. When you cast a cleric spell or cantrip that inflicts radiant damage, you can choose to have it inflict psychic damage instead.
### Channel Divinity: Psychic Feedback
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to disrupt a foe’s mind. When a creature within 30 feet of you has to make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it using your Channel Divinity. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the roll.
If the spell or effect that caused the Wisdom saving throw is not created by a spell you cast, you can also choose to deal psychic damage to the target, equal to half your cleric level, immediately before the target makes its saving throw.
### Gestalt Anchor
Beginning at 6th level, your mental power increases, settling the minds of those around you with your mere presence. Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, the creature gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
### Bend Reality
Starting at 17th level, when you see an ally within 30 feet of you fail a saving throw, you can replace the roll with a 20, potentially changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
