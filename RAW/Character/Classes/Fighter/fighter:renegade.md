***What defines a Renegade is not simply the weapon they wield, or the ways they fight. A renegade, above all else, is a fighter of sly charm and swagger. With brash cockiness in spades, renegades build their own custom firearms to perfectly suit their own larger-than-life personalities. Particularly well-funded renegades may even have personalized Hextech weapons, but such folk are rare among the scoundrels of Bilgewater.***
***Don’t mistake their boasting for an empty facade—folk who underestimate a renegade’s flashy gunplay tend to wind up dead.***

### Scoundrel’s Wit
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the two of the following skills: Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand.
### Gunfighter Form
Additionally, when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin constructing a custom firearm that suits your unique brand of renegade style. This process begins by selecting the form upon which to base your weapon. Each form grants you a new ability and unlocks certain upgrades you can add to your weapon at higher levels. Choose one of the following options:
* **Pistoleer:** Favoring speed and style over raw power, a renegade who adopts the Pistoleer form wields a small flintlock handgun. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 30 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier. The number of shots you can fire during a single action increases when you reach higher levels in this subclass: two shots at 5th level, three shots at 11th level, and four shots at 20th level. The shots can target the same creature or different creatures. Make a separate attack roll for each shot.
* **Sniper:** Armed with a large two-handed firearm, a renegade who adopts the Sniper form can inflict massive damage in a single shot. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 120 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier. You deal extra damage while using this form when you reach higher levels, dealing damage equal to 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier at 5th level, 4d10 at 11th level, and 6d10 at 20th level.
### Weapon of Choice
Through a combination of salvaging stolen pieces of arcane technology and sheer rakish ingenuity, you can customize your firearm with various upgrades. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, pick one minor upgrade and one major upgrade from the [[fighter:renegade:firearm-upgrades|firearm upgrades]] list. If an upgrade has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite in order to benefit from the upgrade.
You gain one additional minor upgrade at 5th level, and one additional major upgrade at 10th level.
### Cunning Shot
Starting at 7th level, you learn to exploit a foe’s weak spots, even if they appear to have none. The damage dealt by your firearm, including damage dealt via Firearm Upgrades, ignores resistances and immunities.
### Grin and Bear It
At 10th level, you can brace yourself in the heat of battle, even when gravely wounded. When you use your Second Wind feature, your AC gains a +1 bonus and your movement speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
### Right Gun for the Job
At 15th level, your skill with your firearm can adapt to any situation. When you finish a long rest, you can replace any of your Firearm Upgrades with a different one, though you cannot have more than two major upgrades equipped at a time. You must still meet the prerequisite of an upgrade in order to benefit from it.
### Light ‘Em Up
At 18th level, you learn to channel the volatile force of your firearm’s black powder into a single concussive blast. As a bonus action, you can either throw or set down a small explosive. If thrown, the explosive has a range of 30 feet and detonates immediately on impact; if set down, the explosive can be detonated remotely from up to 60 feet away as another bonus action.
When detonated, each creature within a 15-foot radius of the explosive must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 force damage on a failure and half as much on a success. The DC for this saving throw is equal to your Firearm Upgrade DC.
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
