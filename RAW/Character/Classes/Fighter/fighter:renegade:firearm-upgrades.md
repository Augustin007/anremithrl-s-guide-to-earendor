***Unlike many tinkerers who labor studiously in their workshops, renegades alter their weapons to suit their personal knavish swagger. The following list provides various options to enhance your firearm’s capabilities. These upgrades may be personal touches you put on your weapon, or scavenged bits of Hextech that you’ve discovered and rigged to work with your weapon.***
**Saving Throws:** Some of these upgrades require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:  
**Firearm Upgrade save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Minor Firearm Upgrades
Blade and Black Powder
***Prerequisite: Pistoleer Form***  
You create a matching blade to accompany your firearm, rendering you a deadly opponent in both melee and ranged combat. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. Additionally, when you use your action to shoot using your Gunfighter Form, you can use your bonus action to strike at a creature within melee range. Make a melee attack roll. The attack roll uses your Dexterity modifier, and you are proficient with the attack. On a hit, the attack deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier.
Caliber Net
By repurposing some salvaged Hextech parts, you equip your gun with an arcane net meant to trap opponents. As an action, choose a creature within range of your firearm. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Collateral Damage
***Prerequisite: Sniper Form***  
You alter your ammunition to have explosive capabilities. When you hit a target with a successful attack from your firearm, all creatures within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage.
Crosshairs
***Prerequisite: 5th level***  
You equip your firearm with a targeting mechanism. If you haven't moved this turn, you can aim down your sights as a bonus action, reducing your speed to 0 and granting you advantage on all attacks you make using your Gunfighter's Form feature until the end of your turn.
Double-Barrel
***Prerequisite: Sniper Form, 5th level***  
You add a second barrel to your firearm. When you use your Gunfighter Form, you can shoot twice during a single action, instead of once. The shots can target the same creature or different creatures. Make a separate attack roll for each shot.
Smoke Screen
As an action, you alter the firing mechanism of your gun to release a burst of ash and smoke. This cloud forms a 10-foot cube centered on a point of your choice within the firearm’s range, spreading around corners, and the area covered by this cube is considered heavily obscured. This smoke lasts for 10 minutes and cannot be dispersed. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
### Major Firearm Upgrades
Barrage
As an action, you can fire a barrage of bullets. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from yourself must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equal to 3d10 + your Dexterity modifier on a failure and half as much on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Double Up
When you hit a creature with a successful ranged weapon attack with a firearm, you can immediately cause the bullet to hit another creature within 15 feet of the original target. The second target takes piercing damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of one). You can redirect a bullet in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.
Lightning Round
You equip your firearm with a volatile piece of stolen Hextech, allowing you to release a piercing bolt of electricity as an action on your turn. The lightning fires from you in a straight line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 lightning damage on a failure and half as much on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Trial by Fire
As a bonus action, you can charge your weapons with blazing force. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you make a successful attack, you deal extra fire damage equal to half your fighter level, rounded up. You can charge your weapons this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses after a short or long rest.
