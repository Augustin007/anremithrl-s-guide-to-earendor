***Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.***

* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a martial weapon
### Ambuscade
Rangers strike first and strike hard. When you roll initiative, you gain a special turn that takes place before other creatures can act. On this turn, you can use your action to take either the Attack or Hide action.
If more than one creature in an encounter has this feature, they all act first in order of initiative, then the regular initiative order begins
If you would normally be surprised at the start of an encounter, you are not surprised but you do not gain this extra turn.
### Natural Explorer
Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.
While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
* Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
* **Archery.** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Blind Fighting.** You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
* **Defense.** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Druidic Warrior.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[spells:druid|druid spell list]]. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the [[spells:druid|druid spell list]].
* **Dueling.** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting.** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
	+ In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting.** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Close Quarters Shooter (UA).** When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
* **Interception (UA).** When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
* **Mariner (UA).** As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to armor class.
* **Tunnel Fighter (UA).** As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.
* **Unarmed Fighting (UA).** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.
	+ When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.
### Skirmisher’s Stealth
Beginning at 2nd level, you combine speed and stealth in combat to make yourself hard to pin down. You are difficult to detect even if you attack or otherwise take actions that would normally reveal your presence.
At the start of your turn, pick a creature you are hidden from. You remain hidden from that creature during your turn, regardless of your actions or the actions of other creatures. As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide again if you fulfill the conditions needed to hide. Otherwise, creatures are aware of you at the end of your turn.
### Spirit Path
At 3rd level, you form a bond with a nature spirit—a companion forged by your link to the wild. This spirit companion protects you as you travel and watches your back in battle. You choose a ranger path that shapes your spirit companion and its magic: the Guardian, the  
Seeker, or the Stalker.

#### Spirit Companion
All rangers gain a spirit companion and the ability to invoke its magical power. (Your spirit companion grants you one benefit you can call  
on in this playtest version of the revised ranger, with more benefits gained at higher levels.) You regain your ability to call on your spirit companion in this way when you finish a short or long rest.
Once per day as a bonus action, you can command your spirit companion to materialize as a living creature, determined by the ranger  
path you choose. Your spirit companion manifests as an animal for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are  
concentrating on a spell). You can also dismiss it as a bonus action.
The manifested creature gains a bonus to attack rolls and saving throws equal to your Wisdom modifier. It uses the hit points in the animal’s stat block or half your hit point maximum, whichever is higher.
The manifested creature takes its turn on your initiative and acts immediately after you. You control its actions, even if you are unconscious or otherwise unable to act.
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
