Source: Unearthed Arcana 81 - Heroes of Krynn
*Prerequisite: Apprentice of High Sorcery*
You've received training from magic-users affiliated with the Mages of High Sorcery.
Choose one of the three moons of Krynn, each of which is associated with a distinct type of magic: the black moon, Nuitari; the red moon, Lunitari; or the white moon Solinari. You learn one cantrip and one 1st-level spell based on the moon you choose, as specified in the Lunar Spells table.
You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
Your spellcasting ability for this featâ€™s spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
