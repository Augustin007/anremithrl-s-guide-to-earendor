You've received training from magic-users affiliated with the Mages of High Sorcery.
Choose one of the three moons of Krynn to influence your magic: the black moon, Nuitari; the red moon, Lunitari; or the white moon Solinari. You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[spells:wizard|wizard spell list]] and two 1st-level spells based on the moon you choose, as specified in the Lunar Spells table.

You can cast each of the chosen 1st-level spells without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spells using any spell slots you have.
