*Prerequisite: 4th Level, Squire of Solamnia Feat*
You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Crown, a group that extols the virtues of cooperation, loyalty, and obedience. You excel in group combat and gain these benefits:
* **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Tactical Teamwork.** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against another creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to grant advantage on the attack roll. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
