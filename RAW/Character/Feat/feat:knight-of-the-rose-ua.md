*Prerequisite: 4th Level, Squire of Solamnia Feat*
You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Rose, a group known for leadership, justice, and wisdom. Your resolve grants you these benefits:
* **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Constitution or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Bolstering Rally.** When you roll initiative, you can choose up to three other creatures you can see within 30 of you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Hit Die + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the ability score increased by this feat. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
