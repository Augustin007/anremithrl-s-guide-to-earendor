You’ve been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Plane of Air, granting you the following  
benefits:
**Elemental Magic.** You learn the [[spell:minor-illusion|minor illusion]] cantrip, using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (choose when you select this feat).
**Wind’s Glide.** You can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. If you are airborne at the end of your turn after using this movement and aren’t held aloft by other means, you fall. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
