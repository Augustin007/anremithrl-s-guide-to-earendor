Youâ€™ve been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Plane of Earth, granting you the following benefits:
**Elemental Magic.** You learn the [[spell:druidcraft|druidcraft]] cantrip, using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (choose when you select this feat).
**Earthen Shield.** You can use a bonus action to conjure a bulwark of earth that provides half cover to you or a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself. The bulwark remains until the start of your next turn. You can create this bulwark a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
