You’ve been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Plane of Fire, granting you the following benefits:
**Elemental Magic.** You learn the [[spell:dancing-lights|dancing lights]] cantrip, using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (choose when you select this feat).
**Fervent Blaze.** You learn the [[spell:produce-flame|produce flame]] cantrip, using the same spellcasting ability chosen for this feat’s Elemental Magic benefit. You can cast produce flame as normal, and you can also cast it as a bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
