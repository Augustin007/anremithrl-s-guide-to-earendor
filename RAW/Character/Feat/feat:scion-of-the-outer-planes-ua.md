You are influenced by and adept at navigating planar pathways and the strange realities of the Outer Planes.
Whether planar essence infuses you or you have extraplanar ancestry, your connection to a plane infuses  
you with the energies found there. Choose a type of plane listed in the Planar Infusion table below. Your choice gives you resistance to a damage type and the ability to cast a cantrip, as specified in the table. You can cast this cantrip without material components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
