*Prerequisite: Gnome (Deep Gnome)*
You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[spell:nondetection|nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component.
You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[spell:blindness-deafness|blindness/deafness]], [[spell:blur|blur]], and [[spell:disguise-self|disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells
