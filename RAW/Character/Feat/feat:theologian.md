Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits.
* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* You learn the [[spell:thaumaturgy|thaumaturgy]] and [[spell:detect-evil-and-good|detect evil and good]] spells. You can cast Detect Evil and Good once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
