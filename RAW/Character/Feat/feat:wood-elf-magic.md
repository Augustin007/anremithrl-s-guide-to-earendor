*Prerequisite: Elf (Wood)*
You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one Druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [[spell:longstrider|longstrider]] and [[spell:pass-without-trace|pass without trace]] spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
