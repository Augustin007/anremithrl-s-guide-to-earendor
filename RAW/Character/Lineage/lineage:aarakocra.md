Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
=================================================
***A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa — mighty beings of air — and were imbued with a measure of their masters’ power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power.***
***From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies — usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.***

* **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
* **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.
* **Size.** Your size is Medium.
* **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Flight.** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.
* **Talons.** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
* **Wind Caller.** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[spell:gust-of-wind|gust of wind]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.
	+ Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast [[spell:gust-of-wind|gust of wind]] with this trait (choose when you select this race).
* **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The *Player’s Handbook* offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

***Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra evoke fear and wonder. Many of these birdfolk hail from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.***
