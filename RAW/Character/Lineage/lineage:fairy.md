Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
=================================================
***The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.***
***Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You’re also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.***
|  | Fey Characteristics |
| d8 | Characteristic |
| 1 | Your wings are like those of a bird. |
| 2 | You have shimmering, multicolored skin. |
| 3 | You have exceptionally large ears. |
| 4 | A glittering mist constantly surrounds you. |
| 5 | You have a small spectral horn on your forehead, like a little unicorn horn. |
| 6 | Your legs are insectile. |
| 7 | You smell like fresh brownies. |
| 8 | A noticeable, harmless chill surrounds you. |

	+ Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
