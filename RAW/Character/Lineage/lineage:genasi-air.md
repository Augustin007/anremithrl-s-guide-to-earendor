Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
=================================================
***Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic.***
***A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years***
***Air genasi are descended from djinn, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Air. Embodying many of the airy traits of their otherworldly ancestors, air genasi can draw upon their connection to the winds.***
***Air genasi’s skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts. Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish-white energy spilling out. An air genasi’s hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor.***
* **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
* **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.
* **Size.** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.
* **Speed.** Your walking speed is 35 feet.
* **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
* **Unending Breath.** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.
* **Lightning Resistance.** You have resistance to lightning damage.
* **Mingle with the Wind.** You know the [[spell:shocking-grasp|shocking grasp]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[spell:feather-fall|feather fall]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[spell:levitate|levitate]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast Feather Fall or Levitate with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
	+ Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
* **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The *Player’s Handbook* offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

=================================
***Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.***
***As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.***
***Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.***
* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and Dexterity score increases by 1.
* **Age.** Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.
* **Alignment.** Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.
* **Size.** Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Unending Breath.** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.
* **Mingle with the Wind.** You can cast the [[spell:levitate|levitate]] spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.
