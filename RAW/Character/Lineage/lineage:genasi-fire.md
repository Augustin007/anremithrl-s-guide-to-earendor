Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
=================================================
***Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic.***
***A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years***
***Descended from efreet, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire genasi channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some bear skin tones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. Fire genasi hair can resemble threads of fire or sooty smoke.***
* **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
* **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.
* **Size.** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.
* **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
* **Fire Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.
* **Reach to the Blaze.** You know the [[spell:produce-flame|produce flame]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[spell:burning-hands|burning hands]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[spell:flame-blade|flame blade]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast Burning Hands or Flame Blade with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
	+ Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
* **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The *Player’s Handbook* offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

=================================
***Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.***
***As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.***
***Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.***
* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
* **Age.** Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.
* **Alignment.** Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.
* **Size.** Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is in a shade of red.
* **Fire Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.
* **Reach to the Blaze.** You know the [[spell:produce-flame|produce flame]] cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[spell:burning-hands|burning hands]] spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.
