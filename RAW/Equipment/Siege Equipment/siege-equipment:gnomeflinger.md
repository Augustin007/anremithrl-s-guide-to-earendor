The gnomeflinger is a catapult designed to hurl creatures, instead of projectiles, in a high arc. The gnomeflinger was designed in conjunction with the narycrash (see the "[[adventuring-gear|adventuring gear]]" page) to hasten transportation. The device can hold one Medium or smaller creature. Before it can be used, the gnomeflinger must be loaded and aimed. It takes 1 action to load the gnomeflinger, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.
While taking an action to aim the gnomeflinger, you set the maximum horizontal distance of the Fling Personnel action to 60 feet, 150 feet, or 300 feet.
A creature that collides with another creature or an object during this trajectory takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet away from the gnomeflinger it is.
