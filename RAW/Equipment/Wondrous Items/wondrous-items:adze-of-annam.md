*Weapon (Greataxe), Artifact (Requires Attunement)*
This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.
**Random Properties.** The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*:
* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 major beneficial property
* 2 minor detrimental properties
**Magic Weapon.** When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional 3d12 force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.
**Divine Mattock.** As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast [[spell:move-earth|move earth]] or [[spell:fabricate|fabricate]]. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
