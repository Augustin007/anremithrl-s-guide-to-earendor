*Armor (medium or heavy), uncommon (requires attunement)*
While wearing this armor, you can use it to cast either [[spell:speak-with-dead|speak with dead]] or [[spell:animate-dead|animate dead]]. Once the armor has cast a spell in this way, it canâ€™t cast either spell until the next dawn.
Your soul keeps this armor together. If you die while you are attuned to the armor, the armor is destroyed.
