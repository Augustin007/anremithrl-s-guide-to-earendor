*Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has proficiency in the Arcana skill)*
Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
As an action, a creature attuned to the *Black Crystal Tablet* can use it to cast *[[spell:eyebite|eyebite]]* or *[[spell:gate|gate]]* (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
