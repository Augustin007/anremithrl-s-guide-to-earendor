*Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)*
You can make a ranged weapon attack with this magic shield. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, and it uses your Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll (your choice). If youâ€™re proficient with shields, you are proficient with attacks made using this shield. On a hit, it deals 1d6 slashing damage. If you throw the shield, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target.
A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
