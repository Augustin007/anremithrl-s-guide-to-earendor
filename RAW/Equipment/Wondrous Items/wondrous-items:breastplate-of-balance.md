*Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)*
This burnished copper breastplate looks as if it were made of interlocking gears. Merchantâ€™s scales are emblazoned across the chest.
The armor has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the armor:
**Equalize.** When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.
**Expunge Imbalance.** As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the [[spell:lesser-restoration|lesser restoration]] spell from the armor.
The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
