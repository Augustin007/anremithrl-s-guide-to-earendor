*Wondrous item, ??? (requires attunement)*
The Cincture of the Stone King is a gray leather belt with square opals.
The belt requires attunement. Once attuned, it grants the following:
* The attuned gains resistance to psychic damage. In addition, they are immune to being paralyzed or petrified and cannot be knocked prone.
* As an action, you can channel your anger to produce a shock wave of thunderous energy, as with the [[spell:thunderwave|thunderwave]] spell. The spell has a DC of 16 and is considered to be cast at fifth level. Once used, you cannot use this feature again until you complete a short rest.
