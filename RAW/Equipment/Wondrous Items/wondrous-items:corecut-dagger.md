*Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)*
This dark metal blade bends in a wicked, hooked curve. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can spend 1 Hit Die to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.
***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, a fact that is  
revealed only when an [[spell:identify|identify]] spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the [[spell:remove-curse|remove curse]] spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.
