*Wondrous item, common*
This bullseye lantern contains an Eberron dragonshard that sheds light comparable to that produced by a [[spell:continual-flame|continual flame]] spell. An *everbright lantern* sheds light in a 120-foot cone; the closest 60 feet is bright light, and the farthest 60 feet is dim light.
