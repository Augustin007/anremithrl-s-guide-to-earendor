*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*
This weapon appears ordinary, but it bears strong illusion magic that allows its wielder to skillfully deceive opponents.
You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While wielding it, you also gain the following benefits:
**Fool’s Feint.** As a bonus action, you can feint, choosing a creature within 5 feet of you as your target. Until the start of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target. Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
**Misdirect.** When a creature within 60 feet of you targets you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to require that creature to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the attack instead targets another creature of your choice that is within the attacker’s reach. Once this reaction has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
