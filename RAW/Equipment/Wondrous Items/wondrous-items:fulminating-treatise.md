*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*
This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[spell:contingency|contingency]], [[spell:fireball|fireball]], [[spell:gust-of-wind|gust of wind]], [[spell:leomunds-tiny-hut|leomund's tiny hut]], [[spell:magic-missile|magic missile]], [[spell:thunderwave|thunderwave]], and [[spell:wall-of-force|wall of force]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.
While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:
* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.
* When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d6 force damage to the creature and knock the creature prone if it is Large or smaller.
