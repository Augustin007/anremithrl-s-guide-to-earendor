*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*
Choose a magical bonus of +1 to +3. This sword gains that bonus to its attack and damage rolls. For each point of bonus you choose for the sword, you take a corresponding penalty (−1 to −3) to your death saving throws. You can change this magical bonus each day at dawn.
***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [[spell:remove-curse|remove curse]] spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.
