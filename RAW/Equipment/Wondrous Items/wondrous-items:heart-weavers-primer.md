*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*
This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[spell:antipathy-sympathy|antipathy/sympathy]], [[spell:charm-person|charm person]], [[spell:dominate-person|dominate person]], [[spell:enthrall|enthrall]], [[spell:hypnotic-pattern|hypnotic pattern]], [[spell:modify-memory|modify memory]], and [[spell:suggestion|suggestion]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.
While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:
* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
* When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
