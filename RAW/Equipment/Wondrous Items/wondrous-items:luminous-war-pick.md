*Weapon (War Pick), Rare (Requires Attunement)*
The haft of this war pick is inlaid with crushed pearlescent stones that imbue the weapon with a faint luminescence. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this war pick.
While wielding the war pick, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[spell:daylight|daylight]] spell, choosing a point on the war pick. Once you use this bonus action, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
