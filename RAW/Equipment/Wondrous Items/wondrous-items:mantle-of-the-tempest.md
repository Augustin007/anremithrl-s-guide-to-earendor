*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has earned the title “Voice of the Tempest”)*
The mantle is made of dark green leathers that unfurl into a cloak of autumn-colored leaves.
*The Mantle of the Tempest* protects its wearer from the penalties of dangerous weather in environments, such as extreme cold, extreme heat, strong winds, and heavy precipitation. It also triples the jump distance of its wearer.
As long as the Mantle is worn, the wearer's AC cannot be less than 16 regardless of what kind of armor they are wearing.
