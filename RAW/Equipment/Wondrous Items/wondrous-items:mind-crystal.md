*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*
These gemstones contain a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic. Different types of mind crystals exist, each with a different single-use effect.
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding a mind crystal, you can modify the spell in a specific way that has an effect described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can’t use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use a mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.
**Careful (Uncommon).** Choose up to three creatures affected by the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.
**Distant (Uncommon).** If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more and doesn’t have a range of self, the spell’s range increases by 100 feet. If the spell has a range of touch, its range becomes 30 feet.
**Empowered (Uncommon).** When you roll damage for the spell, you can reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new rolls.
**Extended (Uncommon).** If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, double the spell’s duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
**Heightened (Rare).** Choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the spell.
**Quickened (Rare).** You change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
**Subtle (Common).** You cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components for this casting.
