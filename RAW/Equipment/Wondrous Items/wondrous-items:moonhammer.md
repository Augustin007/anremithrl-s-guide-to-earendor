*Weapon (warhammer), ??? (???)*
The *Moonhammer*'s handle is made of dark metal that transitions into what looks like glistening ivory closer to the head. On the head are engravings in an unspecified language. Moon crescents are carved on the sides of the warhammer's head. It has the following properties:
* +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
* When used under the moonlight, the *Moonhammer* gains a charge which, once per day, can be used to cast [[spell:greater-invisibility|greater invisibility]] on the wielder.
