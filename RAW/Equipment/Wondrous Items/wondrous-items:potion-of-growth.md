*Potion, uncommon*
When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [[spell:enlarge-reduce|enlarge/reduce]] spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny beat to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
