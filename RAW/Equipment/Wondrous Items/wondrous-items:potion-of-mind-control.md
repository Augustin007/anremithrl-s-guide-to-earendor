*Potion, rarity varies*
When you drink a *Potion of Mind Control*, you can cast a *Dominate* spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.
A *Potion of Mind Control* produces the effect of a [[spell:dominate-beast|dominate beast]], a [[spell:dominate-person|dominate person]] (humanoid), or a [[spell:dominate-monster|dominate monster]] spell (see the table below). If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The charmed creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
| Potion of â€¦ | Rarity |
| Mind control (beast) | Rare |
| Mind control (humanoid) | Rare |
| Mind control (monster) | Very rare |
