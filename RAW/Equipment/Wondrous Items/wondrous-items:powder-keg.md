*Wondrous item, common*
These small wooden barrels are filled with highly volatile gun powder, then magically sealed for easy transport. Setting fire to a keg requires one action and a lit torch, match, or similar magical effect. Once set on fire, a powder keg explodes at the end of the round it is lit, dealing 1d10 fire damage to creatures and objects within 10 feet of it. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.
