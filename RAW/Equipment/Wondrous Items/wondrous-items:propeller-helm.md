*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a small humanoid)*
While worn, the helm allows its wearer to cast the *[[spell:levitate|levitate]]* spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50 percent chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
