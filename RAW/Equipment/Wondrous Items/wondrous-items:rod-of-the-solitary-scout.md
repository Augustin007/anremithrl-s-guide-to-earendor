*Rod, ??? (requires attunement)*
The Rod is a dark metallic rod about two feet long. It has a bit of twilight or a sparkling element to the metal, and at its very end at the base there is a small domed carving.
The Rod gives a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. It requires attunement and one hand free to use. It also contains and can cast three spells: [[spell:grease|grease]], [[spell:magic-mouth|magic mouth]], and [[spell:expeditious-retreat|expeditious retreat]].
