*Armor (any medium or heavy except hide), very rare (requires attunement)*
This magic armor has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While you wear this armor, you gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to psychic damage.
* You can breathe water.
* You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
***Ruidium Corruption.*** When you roll a 1 on a saving throw while wearing this armor, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.
***If Ruidium Is Destroyed.*** If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all of the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and *Ruidium Armor* becomes [[wondrous-items:armor-1-2-3|+1 armor]].
