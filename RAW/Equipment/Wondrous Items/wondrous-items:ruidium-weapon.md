*Weapon (any), very rare (requires attunement)*
This magic weapon has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While this weapon is on your person, you gain the following benefits:
* You can breathe water.
* You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
***Ruidium Strike.*** A creature you hit with this weapon takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.
***Ruidium Corruption.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.
***If Ruidium Is Destroyed.*** If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a Ruidium Weapon becomes a [[wondrous-items:weapon-1-2-3|+2 weapon]].
