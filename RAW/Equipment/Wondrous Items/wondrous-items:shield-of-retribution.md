*Armor (shield), ??? (requires attunement)*
The *Shield of Retribution* is a beautiful polished silver and marble shield. It is exquisitely crafted and shows no signs of wear. It has the following properties:
* The shield adds a +1 to the user's AC in addition to the normal +2 shield bonus.
* If a creature misses a melee attack against the user, the user can use a reaction to blast the attacker with 4d6 arcane force damage. If the creature fails a strength saving throw against the user's spell DC, the creature is also pushed back 20 feet.
