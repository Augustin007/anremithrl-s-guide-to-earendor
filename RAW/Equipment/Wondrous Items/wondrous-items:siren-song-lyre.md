*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
You can use an action to play this lyre and cast one of the following spells from it: [[spell:animal-friendship|animal friendship]], [[spell:charm-person|charm person]], [[spell:enthrall|enthrall]], [[spell:suggestion|suggestion]]. If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.
Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
