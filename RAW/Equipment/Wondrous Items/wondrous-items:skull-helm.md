*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*
While wearing this skull-shaped helm, you have resistance to cold, poison, and necrotic damage.
Additionally, while wearing the helm, you can cast [[spell:spirit-of-death|spirit of death]] from it without requiring material components. Once you use the helm to cast the spell, the helm canâ€™t cast this spell again until the next dawn.
