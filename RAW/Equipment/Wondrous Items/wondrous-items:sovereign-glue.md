*Wondrous item, legendary*
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[wondrous-items:oil-of-slipperiness|oil of slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[wondrous-items:universal-solvent|universal solvent]] or [[wondrous-items:oil-of-etherealness|oil of etherealness]], or with a [[spell:wish|wish]] spell.
