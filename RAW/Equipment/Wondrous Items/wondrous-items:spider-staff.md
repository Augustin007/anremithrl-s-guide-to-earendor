Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)
The top of this magic quarterstaff is shaped like a spider. It deals an extra 1d6 poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.
**Spells.** The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [[spell:spider-climb|spider climb]] (1 charge) or [[spell:web|web]] (2 charges, spell save DC 15).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the staffâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
