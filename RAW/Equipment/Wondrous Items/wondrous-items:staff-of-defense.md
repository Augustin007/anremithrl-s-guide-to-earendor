*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*
This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
**Spells.** The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: *[[spell:mage-armor|mage armor]]* (1 charge) or *[[spell:shield|shield]]* (2 charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.
