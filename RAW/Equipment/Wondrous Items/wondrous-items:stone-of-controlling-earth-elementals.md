*Wondrous item, rare*
If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the [[spell:conjure-elemental|conjure elemental]] spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. This stone weighs 5 pounds.
