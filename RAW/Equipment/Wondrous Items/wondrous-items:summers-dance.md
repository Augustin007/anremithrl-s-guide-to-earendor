*Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)*
This beautiful golden blade appears to bend and flex like a reed with your movements. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
Additionally, the scimitar has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While wielding this scimitar, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to cast the [[spell:misty-step|misty step]] spell.
