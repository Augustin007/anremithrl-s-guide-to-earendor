*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*
When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a [[wondrous-items:sphere-of-annihilation|sphere of annihilation]] while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [[wondrous-items:sphere-of-annihilation|sphere of annihilation]], you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 x your Intelligence modifier.
