*Weapon (sling), rare*
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
When you make a ranged attack with this sling and hit a target, you can cause the ammunition to ricochet toward a second target within 10 feet of the first, and then make a ranged attack against the second target.
