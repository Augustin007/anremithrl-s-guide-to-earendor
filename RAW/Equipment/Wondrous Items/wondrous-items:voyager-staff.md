*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.
This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[spell:banishment|banishment]] (4 charges), [[spell:blink|blink]] (3 charges), [[spell:misty-step|misty step]] (2 charges), [[spell:passwall|passwall]] (5 charges), or [[spell:teleport|teleport]] (7 charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
