*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*
This wand looks and feels like an icicle.
The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: [[spell:ray-of-frost|ray of frost]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), [[spell:sleet-storm|sleet storm]] (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or [[spell:ice-storm|ice storm]] (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No other components are required.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed.
