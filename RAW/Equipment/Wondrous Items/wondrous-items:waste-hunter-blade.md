*Weapon (longsword), ??? (requires attunement)*
This longsword is a dark graphite-color with several hooks across its form, giving it a jagged appearance.
The *Waste Hunter Blade* is especially useful against certain types of creatures: monstrosities and beasts, dealing an additional 1d6 necrotic damage against those types of creatures.
