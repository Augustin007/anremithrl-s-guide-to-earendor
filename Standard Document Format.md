## 1. Establish a Standard Document Format

Each conlang should have a **living reference grammar**. Format it like a professional linguistic description, so anyone you send it to can parse it easily. Suggested sections:

1. **Introduction**

   * Name of the language (exonym and endonym if relevant).
   * Who speaks it (species, culture, gods, etc.).
   * Linguistic inspirations or typological goals.
   * Scope of this document (primer, reference grammar, learner’s intro).

2. **Phonology**

   * **Phoneme inventory** (IPA charts: consonants, vowels, tones).
   * **Phonotactics** (syllable structure, allowable clusters).
   * **Orthography** (romanization, native script, transcription conventions).
   * Prosody (stress, tone, intonation patterns).

3. **Morphology**

   * Word structure overview.
   * Declensions, conjugations, derivational patterns.
   * Inflection tables (case, tense, aspect, mood, voice, person, etc.).

4. **Syntax**

   * Word order (or if free, how morphology handles argument marking).
   * Agreement rules.
   * Clause types (main, subordinate, relative).
   * Questions, negation, focus, topicalization.

5. **Semantics & Pragmatics**

   * Evidentials, honorifics, registers.
   * Nuances of politeness, derision, respect, ambiguity.
   * Core semantic categories (e.g., time, space, kinship, divinity).

6. **Lexicon**

   * Core vocabulary list (frequency list style).
   * Semantic fields (numbers, colors, body parts, ritual terms, everyday life).
   * Word formation rules (compounding, derivation).

7. **Texts & Examples**

   * Sample sentences (with interlinear glossing).
   * Short narrative, prayer, poem, or dialogue.
   * Parallel translations with commentary.

8. **Appendices**

   * Extended paradigms.
   * Scripts/alphabet details if complex.
   * Etymologies if relevant.

## 2. Workflow for Rapid Conlang Production

Think in terms of **modular building blocks** so you don’t reinvent everything each time.

1. **Phonology template**

   * Pre-make 2–3 phoneme inventory archetypes (minimalist, moderate, maximalist).
   * Reuse and adapt rather than building from scratch.

2. **Morphology template**

   * Decide *head-marking* vs. *dependent-marking*.
   * Choose a paradigm type (fusional, agglutinative, polysynthetic).
   * Slot in cases/tense/aspect/mood you want.

3. **Syntax template**

   * Pick base typology (SOV, VSO, free).
   * Decide how relative clauses, questions, and focus are handled.
   * Draft “syntax skeleton” before fleshing details.

4. **Vocabulary expansion**

   * Start with Swadesh list + culturally relevant domains.
   * Decide if words derive from proto-language or symbolic roots.
   * Automate: use scripts/spreadsheets to generate systematic derivations.

1. **Transmission-ready packaging**/

   * Export documents as **PDF grammars** with ToC.
   * Share lexicon as **CSV/Excel** for easy searching/sorting.
   * Use version control (GitHub or Obsidian vault) to keep revisions clear.

## 3. Tools & Formatting Practices

* **Linguistic conventions**:
  Use Leipzig Glossing Rules for interlinear glosses.
