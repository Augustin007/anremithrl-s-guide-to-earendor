On 5421-2-1 a combination of a Full Moon, a Great Ley Shift, and the Winter Solstice resulted in some of the thinnest borders between planes.

Singollo arrives. With Tal'berius's help, Attendant's experiments to siphon time energy and shift it into another realm are used to delay Aoefie's return and to accelerate Theriad's. 

Valus speaks to Colossus about Marethyu.

The attendants bring Spellshot, made of pre-trade Stellatite. (Foreshadow Xandred owning most Stellatite mines before this.)  With ichor can be boosted into a god-affecting spell.

Isendra and Bahamut fight Tartarus as long as they can. 

On the mortal side, Auril attacks with her forces and the Silven Crown. Supported by a number of Shar's beings. The Silven Crown is supplied with stellatite weaponry by the Sons of Xandred. 

The NAF and the Echoes manage to siphon her divinity using the Divine Unbinding spell, reducing her to a powerful mortal, whilst Lysandra uses the moonlight to help drive the enemy away. 
Auril uses her abilities to try to siphon off of local divinity sources like Aric's Sliver, but Liriel kills her and absorbs her power. UnNaming her. This is late in the battle. This causes an enormous earthquake as the planet re-shifts and the snow starts to melt.

Baron Daron and the Analyst die fighting and killing the Silven Crown. 

Ashariel and Thorne sneak in.

Maegard, travelling with the Silven Crown, attacks and kills Valus.

Elmenore betrays them, the spikes of her crown digging in being Hemalurgical, killing Singollo and Glorfindel. Elian destroys her, but it is too late, her troops turn on their own, causing chaos.

Shar's priests manage to complete the ritual, driving in Hemalurgical Spikes into people and opening the Tree. Tartarus passes through, killing Isendra. Bahamut retreats. Hekate attempts to stop him, but as she is Arcane, he easily scatters her. Unmaking her essence. 

Liriel and Aric bind Tartarus to physical form using the Codex of Abraham the Mage.

William uses a spellshot to planeshift him into the gem, but it fails, blocked by the tree. Tartarus Shatters the bonds, destroying the Gem and starting to awaken the Epic Dragons.

Tal'berius time-stops, assisted by Eleutheros, earning them a bit of time. Marethyu speaks in Colossus's mind, giving him the idea to destroy the tree.  They make a new plan. They end the time-stop. Colossus sacrifices himself to Blight the tree. Thalorin's complete awakening Consumes the Order of Names. Thalorin and Gallio grapple Tartarus and Gallio planeshifts them all into his realm. Tal'berius absorbs and redirects the siphoned divinity of the tree across all the planes, creating the Conduit, equalising the time across all the planes and using the temporal energy to stretch time in Gallio's dimension. While Tartarus will no doubt defeat them and plane-shift back. It will take him hundreds, if not thousands, of years. They use the Orb of Anhilation to power it.

Reacting to the Shattering and causing the ashfalls. In the exact moment of this spell, Ashariel touches the remnants of the Tree, and Kas, attempting to stop her, is stopped by Ghalen, who pushes him into the Conduit at the moment of its formation. Kas is expelled beyond the reaches of time and space, aging in an instant. Kas *becomes* Ghalen the Chronomancer. Ashariel tries to follow her husband Kas but is dragged away by Ghalen, who reveals himself as the future version of Kas. She sets Thorne on the rest, destroying those who had sworn to protect the Tree. Aeofie returns, still a sheep. Ashariel takes her and leaves. This was her goal, saving her daughter. 

Tyr, once a god of oaths and justice, who broke his oath to defend the tree, draws away Thorne, buying people time to flee.

Baeor arrives and fights off the remnants of Shar's forces who attack the conduit. 

Nugget and William flee the scene.

Character Recaps:
**Singollo**: The Raven Queen's nephew and the second oldest remaining elf. King of the Elves in the mortal realm.
**Glorfindel**: Singollo's oldest friend, a month younger than him, and general of the elves
**Elian**: Singollo's wife, one of the Elessar. One of the weaker forms of gods. Elessars are of beauty and design and creation.
**Elmenore**: Singollo's cousin, oldest remaining elf, likely to betray them all, unstable 
**Lysandra**: The Spirit of the Moon. The Force of the Tides. A minor goddess alive during the first sundering, Patron of the Aka'lit and of the Lysandran islands. Moonlight. 
**Kas/Ghalen**: The first vampire. Ashariel's husband and the father of Scathatch and Aeofie. Eventually became a chronomancer. 
**Ashariel**: A human given immortality by Tartarus as a curse. Who hates mortals out of jealousy for their short lives, and hates greater immortals for toying with her and others as pawns. Cares only for a select few people.
**Thorne**: Once a man of the Sol'karis, so devoted to the ideas of Oaths and oathbreaking that even death could not prevent him continuing to seek out and punish people who broke oaths. Ashariel gained Command over him when he went after her.
**Tal'berius**: A mad scientist and arcanist, as old as the first Sundering War, with extensive knowledge of everything. Once was Kas's best friend, though they've long parted ways.
**Theriad**: A man devoted to the god of knowledge and learning and teaching. His champion and highest servant, granted immortality by that same god. His followers are known as the Attendants.
**Valus**: Trained by Scathatch, Aeofie's sister, a powerful warrior who gained immortality for himself and his followers by dealing with Marethyu. Maegard, his former friend, long ago turned on Valus, and desires revenge.
**Aric**: A teenager, filled with rage and hate and loss, who absorbed the power of the Sliver of Darkness. Someone who is loyal to their final breath, but everyone he was loyal to has died, except Liriel. Loves Liriel. Has some of the Sliver's memories and experience. Spent some time as a slave. A broken man. Hates how much he loves violence, particularly since the Sliver.
**Liriel**: A genius teenager. Bahamut, the god of foresight, gave her the Codex of Abraham the Mage and she was able to decode it. It consumes her and her ambition. Loves Aric, but she desires power over all else. Her experiences have led her to believe in safety through ambition and power. She's insecure and destructive and selfish. Highly intelligent.
(Aric and Liriel were part of the plot of another campaign, but ideally will bridge well into this one, they were sort of the child soldiers and sacrifices. Children who were forced to bear burdens of power and responsibility so that others wouldn't have to. The other children all died,  including Aric's brother and his best friend, with one exception, Serin, who is somewhere else.)
**Nugget**: Nil'ge'tar, who died and returned as a vampire. Colossus and William's best friend. Sacrificed himself to prevent the destruction of the Tree three years ago. Was tortured in the nine hells for a long time. His sanity siphoned away and used to fuel Tartarus's return, but it has since returned. Blames himself for Tartarus's return.
**Colossus**: King of Gnomes'helm and Marethyu's Voice. Once upon a time the Raven Queen's Champion. Someone devoted to helping and kindness. The 'best of men'.
**William**: A royal ranger from swanward turned into businessman. 
**Baeor**:  Baeor was a half dwarf and half goliath blood, giving him exceptional strength despite seeming human. He was friends with Richard Iwaelfhem in university and was always a good person and natural leader. He always put his life on the line, fighting in the front. He eventually died, but Richard bound his soul into a suit of armour to prevent his permanent death. Richard died centuries ago. He initially refused to participate in the fight, as he no longer wished to be a weapon of destruction, retreating to his demiplane.

Lady Black roles? (Helping Isendra or Eleutheros perhaps, I can't quite figure it out?) She is present but don't seem to have much of a location in my prep. Lady Black is a PC, who followed Eleutheros/Dyonisus/The Traveller, aiding their ascension to Godhood, previously, and went into the nine-hells to convince Tiamat to betray the Betrayer gods, naming her Isendra. A former thief who relied on charm. While she had an important role before, no prep here so far. (Jes Val, an orphan and street urchin, once broke into a lord's house when she was a child, needing to steal food to survive. Lord Amos Black caught her, but he was actually corrupt and ran a criminal empire, and impressed with her quick wits in trying to talk her way out of the situation, and her ability to get into places, he adopted her, and allowed her to grow up as a lady. She became a politician, refining her smooth tongue, discovering a flare for arts, and a criminal leader on the side. In Echoes of Divinity, while on a mission for the criminal empire that she now ran, she was arrested by William Treaty, and ended up joining Colossus, Nugget, PINE-APL, and William on their journey to save the world. She chose not to return to the life of crime, realising how unhappy she had been as a lady and leader of a crime ring, faking her death and following The Traveller. In Shadows of Divinity, she ventured into the Nine Hells to try to convince the Betrayers to aid us, initiating a civil war in the nine hells, and bringing out Isendra.)

Any other roles who seem forgotten here?

[[Session 31b - The Path of Honor]]
Aka'vral's forces arrive at Riulva and see evidence of this fighting, a few miles away. They rush to investigate, arriving moments before the Shattering.

Realising Tartarus's true plan to awaken Azgorath, and in order to prevent the immediate destruction of the world, Colossus uses the Divine Unbinding spell to steal Auril's divinity, but is unable to kill her, revealing the spell to everyone there. Colossus causes the Shattering, destroying the Tree and allowing the protectorate to swoop in. Colossus and Gallio are killed by the ensuing blast. Tal'berius Absorbs the Tree. 
Within stopped time. The fully awakened Thalorin draws Tartarus away to a great battle. Great earthquakes occur. Sections of the atmosphere ignite as the Divine Ley lines collapse. Azgorath and the Epic Dragons stir in their slumber. Ghalen prevents Kas from killing Ashariel when she arrives, by shoving him into the growing threads from the Conduit. Lady Black dies in the chaos. Other things occur. Maegard kills Valus. Tal'berius Auril's divinity to form The Conduit, stabalising the Planes, undoing Dur'bagaal's and Atropus's first act of destruction at the beginning of the Eternal Wars, and thus allowing the Arcane Leywrite to allow Tal'berius to comprehend and channel the power of the Trees. Grumbar is awakened as time flows properly again. The Shadow is freed. Tal'berius kills Hekate, scattering her essense across the Material Plane.
The conduit ends the Time Stop, and any other time-fluctuating effects, expelling Kas from Time and Space, converting him into the Chronomancer Ghalen. 
Nil'ge'tar and William Treaty retreat with the combined armies of the NAF and DragonArrow.
As everyone flees and retreats, the Aboleth dead, the lake evaporated, tree destroyed, Aka'vral and Arthur's forces scout the area. Arthur sees the conduit laying on the ground and wonders what it is, nearly touching it and expelling himself to Ghalen. Talberius stands where the tree once was, slowly ascending beyond his previous locations, the orb of anhilation is cracking in his arm. 
Cordast Tresant observes this, planning.
[[Session 31b - The Path of Honor]]
Aka'vral and Arthur's forces are met by Ashariel. 
[[Session 32b - The Path of Honor]]
Aka'vral and Arthur rescue Taelardan.
