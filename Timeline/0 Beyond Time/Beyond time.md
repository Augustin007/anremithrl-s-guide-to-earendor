> There is the first cause. From this cause all else is. There is the first cause, and from this, Ao and Isfet are. They are the King of Order and the Queen of Chaos. And they were, are, and will be caused at all times, or no times, everywhere and nowhere. They are beyond time and beyond space. Beyond the notion of beginnings and endings. All there is, there, is a notion of _causation_, and they were not the first cause.
> 
> And they, in turn, caused almost-time and almost space, and they entered it, so that they may spend some time of it together. In the almost-time and space, things formed. And they swirled and moved. They were one way then another. And it was beautiful and fascinating. And Ao and Isfet wished to perfect it. But they could not. 
> 
> From their union, in the almost, emerged the Firstborn. These are the first beings to have a beginning, the first beings that could ever have an end. These were the two sisters Selûne and Shar, the twins of light and dark. They are called so, for Selûne always tended to good, and was filled with the love handed down through Ao and through Isfet from the First Cause, and it is said that Selûne had the double portion of this love, for Shar had none of it.
> 
> in the very next that was, Asgorath and Arambar emerged, and unlike Selune and Shar, they were enamoured with time and space, and they wished to perfect it, for they were it's embodiment. They were formed of the love of Ao and Isfet for the Almost. They were more ephemeral and moody. Ever changing, and bound to time, but loved creation and order. The Cosmic Twins were more powerful than their elder sisters. Within the bounds of almost time and almost space, they created structures that held it together and stable. They formed the Universe, the Aether of Spacetime. And Ao and Isfet could not enter it, for they had no beginning or end.
> 
> Four others emerged, in this order: Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akida, and these are the Primordials of the Dawn. They children of Ao and Isfet, before they retreated from the almost.


> **From _The Chronology_ by Ghalen**
> 
> Beyond time and space there is only a sense of causation, not of beginning or end. Everything is all at once in a stable manner, collapsed into a fixed point.
> 
> Within it all, there is the first cause, and from there, Ao and Isfet are _caused_. 
> 
> They, in turn, created the almost time. ...\* In almost time, there is no sense of continuous time and space, but there is a sense of _next_, and of nearness. Things that enter or exit will be present at all points of it, and join again at any point 'after' to leaving, but only be one continuous presence outside of it. While beyond time and space order is supreme, in this almost time and space, chaos is more powerful.
> 
> The weaving of almost space and time is not perfect. Almost time exists in some places where almost space doesn't, and the other is also true.

_\*\[Ghalen here goes on a tangent, explaining how almost time forms a cotangent bundle\]_ 

> **From the writings of Rondar**
> Time and Space are bound by that with Hast named the _Aether_. It is as threads, woven throughout. Vibrating and pulling at each other. We see a small portion of that. And they hate to move. Theories conflict, but I personally measure twenty-three dimensions of freedom. Where they intersect with the three dimensional slice which is our plane of existence, it forms the barest particles of existence.

> **From the accounting of Methunroa**
> 
> At first there were only the Queen of Chaos and the King of Order. They were older than the Universe. From where they came nothing is known. It is said only that they simply *are*.
> 
> But they created the almost-time and almost-space, so that they may have a little of it together, and from this union emerged the Firstborn. These were the two sisters Selune and Shar, the twins of light and dark. 
> 
> Six Primordials emerged from the almost-time before the dusk.
> 
> First there emerged the Cosmic Twins—Arambar and Asgorath.
> 
> Arambar was quite and contemplative. He was endlessly patient, and always considered the implications of his actions. He was a very deliberate person, and a very quite person. He was the most powerful of the children of Chaos and Order. Thus he became known as the Arambar the Titan.
> 
> Asgorath, his twin, was meticulous and precise. He was obsessive and shortsighted. But he saw great visions and paused not to consider whether it was possible for them to create. He voiced his opinions, and led his brother into many things. And it was his mind that first conceived the idea of a Universe, and so he became known as Asgorath the World-Shaper
> 
> Then came the Elemental Siblings—Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akadi.
> 
> Grumbar is quiet and still. He is the eldest of the Elemental siblings. He is always slow to anger, but even slower to forgive. He was much like Arambar, patient and unyielding. He is the peace-maker between his siblings. Thus he is known as Grumbar the Steadfast. 
> 
> Istishia is ever-changing and moody. But she is forgetful and rash. She is greatly beautiful and loved by all, but she loves none back, save Akadi. She is eternally unpredictable, and she can shift from being temperamental to peaceful to destructive to reserved in a matter of seconds. She is the most powerful and dangerous of the elemental siblings. She is called Istishia the Terrible.
> 
> Kossuth is quick to rise in anger but also quick to forgive. He is fiercely loyal, most particularly to his younger sister Akadi, who he adores; and to Asgorath, who crafted his plane. Kossuth is warm and kind when at peace but fierce and destructive when provoked. He is known as Kossuth the Fierce.
> 
> Akadi is the youngest, and she is filled with laughter. She is ever-free and light-hearted. No one can find it in their heart to find strife with her. Akadi is most beloved by her older siblings, especially Kossuth, who is fiercely protective of her. And she is known as Akadi the Gentle.
> 
> Now, Akadi was but new-come into almost-time when Asgorath began a great work. He spoke with his twin, and they created the Aether, and they began to weave it into the Universe. And they offered to each of their family to make them a plane in this Universe.
> 
> Now their parents, Chaos and Order, dwelt outside of even almost-time, and touched it only in glancing blows, and for their part they chose to remain far away, and their elder sisters followed suit, dwelling in the edges of the almost.
> 
> And so it was that the Cosmic twins wove together Aether and Time, and built five of the True Planes. 
> 
> For their Elemental siblings, they built a Plane each, and for themselves they created the Ethereal Plane, a realm woven throughout the Universe, connected to all of the planes. And they built there their homes.
> 
> And each of the Elemental Siblings took to their planes and fashioned their own creations.
> 
> Grumbar created Earth, and he filled his home with it. And the realm became known as the Caverns of Stillness. It is a labyrinthine network of tunnels, chambers, and vast underground landscapes, all made of various forms of earth and stone. 
> 
> Istishia created the water, reflecting her ever-changing nature. And she named her realm the Cresting Spires. The water can be as still as a pond in one moment and as turbulent as a stormy sea in the next. Towering waves rise and fall. 
> 
> Kossuth with his own blazing passions sparked the Undying Pyre. It is a landscape of fire, where rivers of lava flow through mountains of fire. And the realm is most beautiful, for the fires fly in all colors, and they illuminate all the wonders there.
> 
> Akadi, who was but newly come into being, and filled with laughter, fashioned the element of air. The Gentle Zephyr is a realm of boundless skies and ceaseless winds. It is a place of constant movement, where air currents twist and spiral into complex patterns, creating a never-ending dance of wind and cloud.
> 
> We named them Elements, and these are not the elements of us, the Wizards. Of the Alchemists and Chemists, like Oxygen and Iron and Argon, but instead represent a shift, or a state. Grumbar with the creation of mass and matter and solid, Istishia transforming it into movement, and liquid. Kossuth his fire, lightning, energy and it's movement, and Akadi with air.
> 
> And so, these six—Akadi, Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, Arambar, and Asgorath—were the first to bear the title of Primordials, for they were the first to truly create, and the planes were their dominion and their masterpiece.
> 
> These were the children of chaos and order. These were the Primordials of Dawn.
> 
> And when the realms were forged, then began the age of the Primordials.
