# Beyond Time
---
There is the first cause. From this cause all else is, from this, Ao and Isfet are. They are the King of Order and the Queen of Chaos. And they were, are, and will be caused at all times, or no times, everywhere and nowhere. 

They are beyond time and beyond space. Beyond the notion of beginnings and endings. All there is, there, is a notion of _causation_.

And they created Almost-Time and Almost-Space, that they may have a little of it together, and from this union emerged the Firstborn. These were the two sisters Selune and Shar, the twins of light and dark.

(Beyond time and space there is only a sense of causation, not of beginning or end. Everything is all at once in a "stable" manner.)
There is the first cause, and from there, Ao and Isfet are _caused_. They are the King of Order and the Queen of Chaos. And they were caused at all times, or no times, everywhere and nowhere.

(In almost time, time and space are curved and bundled. Within it, there is no sense of continuous time and space, but there is a sense of _next_. Of spending moments together. It was caused by Ao and Isfet, and things that enter or exit will be present at all points of it, and join again at any point 'next' to leaving, but only be one continuous presence outside of it. While beyond time and space order is supreme, in this almost time and space, chaos is more powerful. The overlappings aren't perfect. Almost time exists in some places where almost space doesn't, and vice versa.)

And they, in turn, caused almost-time and almost space, and they entered it, so that they may spend some time of it together.
In the almost-time and space, things formed. And they swirled and moved. They were one way then another. And it was beautiful and fascinating.
And Ao and Isfet wished to perfect it. But they could not. 
From their union emerged first Selûne and Shar, the twins of light and darkness. These are the first beings to have a beginning, the first beings that could ever have an end.
And in the very next that was, Asgorath and Arambar emerged, and unlike Selune and Shar, they were enamoured with time and space, and they wished to perfect it, for those were the desires that they had. They were more ephemeral and moody. Ever changing, but loved creation and order. The Cosmic Twins were more powerful than their elder sisters. They saw the work of the others and perfected it. Time and space as it is. Within the bounds of almost time and almost space, they create structures that hold it together and stable. They formed the Universe, an Aether, a substance which dragged things within it, causing a continuum. Infinite dimensions of freedom and movement. 

And Ao and Isfet could not enter it, for they had no beginning or end.

Four others emerged in this era, in this order: Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akida. And these are the Primordials of the Dawn. The children of Chaos and Order, before they retreated from the almost-was.

At first there were only [[The Queen of Chaos and The King of Order|the Queen of Chaos and the King of Order]]. They were older than the Universe. From where they came nothing is known. It is said only that they simply *are*.

But they created the almost-time and almost-space, so that they may have a little of it together, and from this union emerged the Firstborn. These were the two sisters [[Selune]] and [[Shar]], the twins of light and dark. They were the first brushstrokes on the canvas of reality and the initial notes in the symphony of existence.

But the age of the Primordials had not yet begun.

## The Primordials of Dawn

Six Primordials emerged from the almost-time before the true beginning of the age of the Primordials. 

First there emerged the Cosmic Twins—[[Arambar]] and [[Asgorath]].

Arambar was quite and contemplative. He was endlessly patient, and always considered the implications of his actions. He was a very deliberate person, and a very quite person. He was the most powerful of the children of Chaos and Order. Thus he became known as the Arambar the Titan.

Asgorath, his twin, was meticulous and precise. He was obsessive and shortsighted. But he saw great visions and paused not to consider whether it was possible for them to create. He voiced his opinions, and led his brother into many things. And it was his mind that first conceived the idea of a Universe, and so he became known as Asgorath the World-Shaper

Then came the Elemental Siblings—[[Grumbar]], [[Istishia]], [[Kossuth]], and [[Akadi]].

Grumbar was quiet and still. He is the eldest of the Elemental siblings. He is always slow to anger, but even slower to forgive. He was much like Arambar, patient and unyielding. He is the peace-maker between his siblings. Thus he was known as Grumbar the Steadfast. 

Istishia is ever-changing and moody. But she is forgetful and rash. She is greatly beautiful and loved by all, but she loves none back, save Akadi. She is eternally unpredictable, and she can shift from being temperamental to peaceful to destructive to reserved in a matter of seconds. She is the most powerful and dangerous of the elemental siblings. She is called Istishia the Terrible.

Kossuth is quick to rise in anger but also quick to forgive. He is fiercely loyal, most particularly to his younger sister Akadi, who he adored; and to Asgorath, who crafted his plane. Kossuth is warm and kind when at peace but fierce and destructive when provoked. He is known as Kossuth the Fierce.

Akadi is the youngest, and she is filled with laughter. She is ever-free and light-hearted. No one can find it in their heart to find strife with her. Akadi is most beloved by her older siblings, especially Kossuth, who is fiercely protective of her. And she is known as Akadi the Gentle.

Now, Akadi was but new-come into almost-time when Asgorath began a great work. He spoke with his twin, and they created Time and Aether, and they began to weave them into the [[Eärendor|Universe]]. And they offered to each of their family to make them a plane in this Universe.

Now their parents, Chaos and Order, dwelt outside of even almost-time, and touched it only in glancing blows, and for their part they chose to remain far away, disconnected, and disinterested.

Their elder siblings, Selune and Shar, were more like their parents, and they chose to remain in almost-time. 

And so it was that the Cosmic twins wove together Aether and Time, and built five of the True Planes. 

For their Elemental siblings, they built a Plane each, and for themselves they created the Ethereal Plane, a realm woven throughout the Universe, connected to all of the planes. And they built there their homes.

And each of the Elemental Siblings took to their planes and fashioned their own creations, and they named them Elements.

Grumbar created Earth, and he filled his home with it. And the realm became known as the [[Caverns of Stillness]]. It is a labyrinthine network of tunnels, chambers, and vast underground landscapes, all made of various forms of earth and stone. 

Istishia created the water, reflecting her ever-changing nature. And she named her realm the [[Cresting Spires]]. The water can be as still as a pond in one moment and as turbulent as a stormy sea in the next. Towering waves rise and fall. 

Kossuth with his own blazing passions sparked the [[Undying Pyre]]. It is a landscape of fire, where rivers of lava flow through mountains of fire. And the realm is most beautiful, for the fires fly in all colors, and they illuminate all the wonders there.

Akadi, who was but newly come into being, and filled with laughter, fashioned the element of air. The [[Gentle Zephyr]] is a realm of boundless skies and ceaseless winds. It is a place of constant movement, where air currents twist and spiral into complex patterns, creating a never-ending dance of wind and cloud.

And so, these six—Akadi, Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, Arambar, and Asgorath—were the first to bear the title of Primordials, for they were the first to truly create, and the planes were their dominion and their masterpiece.

These were the children of chaos and order. These were the Primordials of Dawn.

And when the realms were forged, then began the age of the Primordials.
