> Selune and Shar settled on the ends of the almost and that which was. Selune had proper space, but only almost time. Her light was eternal and undying. Everpresent. Shar had time, but only almost space, and her land was called the Abyss, for her darkness and evil filled it all.
> 
> Arambar and Azgorath, in true time and space, formed of Aether the borders of the planes, and made five true planes. Five homes. One for the two of them, and one for Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akadi. And the planes burgeoned fractaly, and created other planes and pockets and demiplanes and quasiplanes. 
> 
> Others emerged, then. Even more ephemeral and less powerful. Here emerged Ubtao and Atropus and Durbagaal, Talos and Nehusta.  Those that emerged in this time are named the Primordials of the Dusk. 
> 
> The most notable, from that pushing of the universe against the almost was emerged Tartarus, and he was the greatest of the Dusk. And he emerged first from the Abyss, and is the only creature that Shar has ever loved.
> 
> There emerged lesser beings, too. With swift beginnings and ends. And the primordials ignored them. These were the Aetherborn. And from them came those that call themselves githzerai and githyanki, which were more corporeal. Their minds were not truly distinct, but psionically held between them, and they did not die quite as mortals did, for their bodies were not important. But all the same they had beginnings and ends. 
> 
> From the Dusk, the Children of the Dusk were created. Stewards of their creations and homes. Servants. Some of lesser and some of greater power. 
> 
> Talos and Nehusta in this time unite and create the Elessar, known as the first of the gods.
> 
> Time as it was then is difficult to measure or to count. But it is thought to be at least on the order of a few hundred thousand years ago while others say millions or even trillions of years ago. 


> **From the accounting of Methunroa**
> 
> And so came the Primordials of Dusk, born from the ever-expanding tapestry of existence, yet neither of the same essence nor power as their predecessors. They were more bound to their forms and essence, tied more closely to the Aether and to Time, except Tartarus, who was more like the Dawn in his nature, and dwelt often in the Abyss. They were these, in order of their coming into existence: Telos the Unstoppable, Tartarus of the Abyss, Nehusta the builder, Dur-baagal the Cold and Cruel, Ubtao the Deceiver, and Atropus the Elder Evil.
> 
> These were the Primordials of Dusk, and the Dawn ignored them, yet they were not alone for long. For from their essence sprang the Children of the Dusk, a myriad of lesser beings, confined to the domains and realms their parents had shaped. They were stewards, guardians, and caretakers, but they lacked the raw, shaping power of the true Primordials. They were but echoes of the Dusk, Primordials of Night. These are not the Aetherborn, from which the Gith claim to descend, and indeed, evidence of the Aetherborn seems scant.
> 
> Telos and Nehusta dwelt together, in the pockets of Aether and Time that burgeoned into demiplanes, and there they created many things. And they were content together, though they were greatly different.
> 
> Telos is a methodical builder, and he builds things of great use but of little beauty. He only begins projects he believes he could finish, and he embodies the essence of persistence and focus. And for this he is called the Unstoppable. 
> 
> Nehusta, on the other hand, is a whirlwind of creativity, her essence a vibrant tapestry of ideas and possibilities, and she is called the builder. She is easily inspired and easily distracted, always beginning new projects with a burst of enthusiasm, but never finishes.
> 
> But together, Telos and Nehusta find a harmonious balance. Where Telos provides the focus and determination to see a project through, Nehusta infuses it with creativity and flair. His methodical nature is the perfect counterpoint to her spontaneity, and her imagination breathes life into his meticulous plans. In their pocket realms they built many things, and they created the Elessar to help them create. One hundred they made them. The Elessar are the eldest of the gods, and only they remember the time before the Eternal Wars.
> 
> Now Tartarus did not dwell among the Dusk, he never minded existing outside of Aether and Time, for he was formed from the edges of the Universe, from the quasi-planes that formed from where the Universe touched that that was beyond. Instead he left to stay in the Abyss with Shar, and the two were of one mind always, and there has never been any lies nor strife that passed between them. They are both creatures of Emptyness, and they held the others in disdain, for they were creatures of destruction, and even before the Children of the Dusk they already plotted the downfall of the Dawn.
> 
> Ubtao dwelt in the Root Hold within the Caverns of Stillness. For he did not love to be disturbed. Ubtao possessed the unique ability to perceive the hearts and minds of all that were, even Chaos and Order far away. And he was overwhelmed by it. He found his sanctuary in the quiet depths where Grumbar seldom stirred. Akadi would often come to visit him, and she was quite and gentle, and he did not mind her presence.
> 
> Dur-baagal secluded himself in Frostfell, the Paraelemental Plane between Akadi and Istishia. He had desired them both, and they had scorned him. Angered and rejected, Dur-baagal's realm became a frigid wasteland, a reflection of his own cold and cruel nature. And he spoke only to Atropus.
> 
> And Atropus found a home for some time in the The Dark Regions, where the Abyss bordered the Ethereal Plane. For though Shar whispered to him many sweet falsehoods, and he believed she loved him, he could not bear to leave the Aether and Time from which he was formed.
