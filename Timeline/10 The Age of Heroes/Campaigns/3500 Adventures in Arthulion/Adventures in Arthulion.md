Duthrim, Jason, and Theriad travel around the region of Arthulion. Eventually ending up in Destishire.
After the eruption of the flameheart, many people are displaced, this includes Duthrim, who wanders around seeking work, eventually he meets Jason, a wanderer, and the two being travelling the world taking on odd jobs, Duthrim hoping to eventually find stability, and Jason looking for glory and honor. 
Theriad is rescued from the flameheart eruption by elves, and studies in Nolorei. He returns to Nerheim as it is being rebuilt, but clashes with the Sonorous lords and is forced to flee. He meets Duthrim and Jason. Duthrim and Theriad bond over being displaced by the eruption.
Duthrim leaves the party for some time, settling in Othron Ibrith. Jason and Theriad both attend the Clockwork Citadel Institute, a university. Theriad studies under Methunroa and becomes an accomplished scholar, and begins worshipping a figure from his visions, who he now recognises as Nebelum.
Jason and Theriad are involved in several incidents at the university.
Duthrim's children are kidnapped, and the three join again to free them. Travelling again, Jason realises how much he missed the freedom, and adventures on his own.
Theriad settles in Khar and Duthrim moves there too (fearing another kidnapping). Theriad continues to study.
They defend the small remote village they live in from various threats.
Theriad has visions that he must travel again, and find the location to build his new library.
Jason eventually returns, asking for their help to defeat a strange woman known as Me. Jason is travelling with a strange sorceress named Bechel.
After failing badly, they're all captured save Bechel, who leaves them to die.
Duthrim dies in the escape, and the other two travel East. 
Theriad insults a corrupt king and they flee. Eventually they end up in Destishire.
