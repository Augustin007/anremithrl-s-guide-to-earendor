After fleeing Destishire, and meeting Bechel of Baram, Theriad works on achieving his dream of constructing the lorekeep.
Theriad flees Destishire and winds up in the north. He meets Bechel again, who has become the leader of a cult, and lost her eyesight, After some brief dealings with her, they part on unfriendly terms. Theriad travels through Othron Ibrith, Sholara, and Arithmorei, learning more about his god at each point and helping people he meets. He constructs a new spell, the teleportation circle, and spreads it among his order, keeping it a secret outside, and monetises it for his order. (People pay for memberships or for travel through teleportation circles.) He travels across the ocean to Veloria after a vision, and travels through the Untamed Lands until he finds the right place for his library, fighting a powerful demon in the land and beginning the construction.
