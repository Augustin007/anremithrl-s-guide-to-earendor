The Age of Heroes was a renaissance of sorts, a period of resurgence that followed the grim and tumultuous Age of Shadows. It was a time when the virtues of courage, wisdom, and unity were not just ideals but necessities for survival and progress.

- **Rise of Heroes**: This age was named for the great heroes who emerged, individuals of extraordinary skill and valor. They took it upon themselves to rid the world of lingering abominations, remnants of the Sundered Wars and the dark magic of the Age of Shadows.

- **Vestiges of the Past**: The discovery of ancient artifacts and magical relics from the time of the Sundered Wars became a focal point. These vestiges were sought after not just for their power but for the wisdom they contained, offering insights into long-forgotten magics and technologies.

- **Undoing Dark Magic**: Wizards and scholars of immense power and knowledge worked tirelessly to reverse the malevolent spells and curses left by the Betrayer gods. Their efforts cleansed tainted lands and restored natural order, gradually diminishing the dark magic that had plagued the world.

- **Formation of Alliances and Empires**: As stability returned, various kingdoms and tribes found common ground. Alliances were forged, leading to the establishment of the first great empires. These empires became bastions of governance and law, bringing much-needed order to the Ephemeral Lands.

- **Focus on Wisdom and Knowledge**: The age saw the founding of the first universities and scholarly institutions. Wisdom and knowledge were highly valued, and these centers of learning became the crucibles where the next generation of leaders, scholars, and heroes were forged.

- **Conflicts and Challenges**: Despite the progress, the age was not without its share of conflicts. Territorial disputes, power struggles, and ideological differences led to wars and skirmishes. However, these conflicts were generally less devastating compared to those of previous ages, and they often led to social and political advancements.

The Age of Heroes was a transformative period that left an indelible mark on the history of the Ephemeral Lands. It was an era that saw the best of what mortals could achieve when united by common goals and enlightened by wisdom. The legacies of this age would serve as the cornerstone for future generations, a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people.
