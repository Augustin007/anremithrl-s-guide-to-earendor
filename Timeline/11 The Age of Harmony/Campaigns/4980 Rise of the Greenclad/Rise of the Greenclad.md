Zahel-ben-minos, Sebastian Valerius, and Helena Naema all fight against the rising order of the Greenclad and navigate the complex politics of Neros.
Can't find notes, might be on old computer. In short, Zahel is a detective investigating a murderer, Helena is a member of the information department, and a friend of Zahel's who is told to warn him to stop investigating, Sebastian is a shapeshifting prodigy and college student who spies on people and thus is known by the other two. They begin uncovering a larger plot by the Greenclad, deep corruption, etc. King is about to die with no heirs, different people vying for the throne. They support a Dechaius ascension to the Throne, help dismantle the corruption, etc. Thorondor and Tormac and stuff. Richard is here too.
