Session XXXIII: Bombs and Battles
- Rymfelli raiders attack the port. This is a big deal politically.
- The party tries to flee in the chaos, but are spotted by raiders. 
- They use a smokescreen and shoot the arcubalistae. Some board, but are dispached by Nugget and William.
- Colossus, blind still, falls off the boat, but pulls into the astral plane. The wax still blinds him there.
- They catch him. Colossus uses fire and melts off the mask as best he can, leaving disfigured mask remains on his face. The raiders are attacking. 
- They shatter the enemy boat, but are in need of repairs. They port again upstream from Oracus.
- Colossus and the party argue about Kalquend and the loot. Colossus refuses to take any of Kalquend's things. The party doesn't tell him the truth about Kalquend.
