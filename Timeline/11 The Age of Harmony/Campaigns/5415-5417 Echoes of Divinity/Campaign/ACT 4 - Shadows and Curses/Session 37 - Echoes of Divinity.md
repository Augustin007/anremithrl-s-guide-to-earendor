- Colossus announces his intentions to travel to Thilcerth. He wants to go the the Fortress of Memory and challenge the walls for the right to be champion. Nugget supports him at Azmodeus's will.
- The party takes turns drawing cards, while Colossus broods belowdecks about Kalquend. He decides to give the party a chance since they are supporting him now.
- They trick Colossus into drawing a card. He gains three wishes. Angered, he chooses not to use them.
- Nugget laughs Colossus off as he tells them to draw no more cards. He draws a card and his soul is sucked away to the nine hells.
- They reach the arches of Thilcerth, an enterence to the shadowfell.
