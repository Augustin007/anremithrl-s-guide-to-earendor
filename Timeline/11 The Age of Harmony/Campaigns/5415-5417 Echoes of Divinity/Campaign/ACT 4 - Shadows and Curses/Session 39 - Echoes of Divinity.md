Session XXXIX: Memories and Monsters
- Colossus encounters a wraith. He fights it and loses, but uses illusions to scare it away in the end, showing life and happiness and comfort.
- The party heads into Thilcerth and tries to figure out how to get Nugget back.
- Colossus reaches the Halls of Memory. He touches the outer curtain and is immediately immersed in the past. He sees his past self urging the mob, he sees people being trampled. He sees the massacre he helped create.
- He confronts his past self. Every argument he makes, his past self turns aside, just as he knew he would. He seperates himself from his past self, vowing to never be like that again, filled with hatred. His memory clears and he sees again. There is now a door in the wall, and he enters.
