Session XLII: Curses and Consequences
- Azmodeus appears in the Fortress, using the link from the mask. He confers alone with Colossus. He agrees to free Nugget if Colossus agrees to not undo the curse left on him by his mask, explaining how he orchestrated Colossus getting the mask. Colossus agrees if Asmodeus changes the curse so that it undoes itself the moment Colossus wants to, and to free Nugget from his service. Asmodeus agrees to change the curse to include that clause, but that Nugget must render one last service to Asmodeus.
- The curse is changed, Colossus cannot want to remove it, or want to want to remove it, or want to want to want to... et al.
- Asmodeus uses careful phrasing to trick the party into thinking he is giving them Azmodeus of his own free will, and consumes the man in fire as an offering.
