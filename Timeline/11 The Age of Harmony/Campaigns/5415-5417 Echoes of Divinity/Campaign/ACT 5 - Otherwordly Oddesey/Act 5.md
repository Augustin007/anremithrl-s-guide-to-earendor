- Nugget and PINE-APL are unnafected. They watch the party start to seperate, along with the ship's crew, and try to free each of their illusions.

- William manages to salvage the mushrooms and plans to use them.
- Nugget manages to save Colossus.
- Lady Black finds her way through the forest, seperated from the group, and sees elves dancing and drinking. She joins in, and quickly finds she cannot physically stop dancing or laughing and drinking.

- They get attacked by some form of illusion monster as they try to regroup the people.
- From 12, five of the crewmates are not found when they regroup at the ship.
- Lady Black is woken and questioned by an elf. After some harsh words, she is exiled from their court and rejoins the party.
Session XLVI - Chaotic Realms
- As the party continues on their journey, they are met with strange sights and experiences that defy logic and reason. Water flows like solid ground, while solid ground flows like water, and a sign that controls gravity. They even come across an ocean where birds swim upside down underwater, and fish float upside down in the air, causing the group to question their own perceptions.
- Illusions seem to meld with reality, becoming more and more difficult to traverse.
- The party reaches a city named Lavore.

Session XLVII - Lavore's Laughs and Traveler's Tricks
- Lost in the city, unable to speak the language, they are approached by a man who names himself Eleutheros. He is an ascending arch-fey elf quasi-deity. 
- He gives them a guidebook that changes based on their expectation and shows different things to each person.
- They navigate the city with difficulty. 
- He tells them that to get back, they must speak with the unforgiving lady and confront Seelie.
- The Traveller gives Lady Black his Sigil and a set of bracelets for her to use to teleport her friends around.
- In the end, through a long and convoluted route, they make it to the other side of the city. (Two people, William and Colossus, just went straight across, ignoring the guidebook, and got there way earlier, drinking illusion-summoned drinks, waiting for the others)
- PINE-APL finishes development of his brand-new weapon.
Session XLVIII - Facing the Unforgiving Lady
- The party speaks with the Unforgiving Lady. Loquail is at her side. She seems unstable. She ends up leaving. The moment Loquail steps out of her protection, William and PINE-APL attack and kill him with PINE-APL's new weapon, the distancer (gun) and bowshot.
