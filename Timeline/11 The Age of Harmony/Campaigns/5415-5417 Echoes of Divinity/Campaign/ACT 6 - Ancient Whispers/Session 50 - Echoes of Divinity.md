Session L: Meeting Talberius
- Here they meet Tal'berius, the Architect Arcane who chose to stay. He seems to change his mind constantly, and never sleeps. He seems incredibly tired and moody. He's rude to PINE-APL but insanely wealthy, and has scrapped most items in the town for their parts for his inventions. Everything in his laboratory has also been moved to the vault.
- They talk with him and agree to go further north to recover one of his goods that he claims was stolen by a man known as Faledric.
