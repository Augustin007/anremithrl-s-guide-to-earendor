- Lady Black calls upon Eleutheros to help.
- Colossus is trying to mind link to Nugget to steal the information running through his body. PINE-APL blows himself up to block the link.
- Nugget speaks to a voice in the gem. The gem is the labyrinth stone, the Voice is Tartarus, trapped inside. Nugget frees him with an unbreakable vow that Tartarus must kill Azmodeus. This distracts Azmodeus and Nugget regains enough control to break his own arm, and begs Lady Black to kill him.
