The Tyr was the ship bought the heroes of Echoes of Divinity around the continent for their adventures, but when the heroes obtained a new ship, they hired men to crew this ship on a side mission. This is the story of that crew.
The eight members aboard the Tyr make it to the land of Suptyu. They try to sell their goods and fulfill their contract, but the goods get stolen. They chase after the goods.  The crew meet their own share of adventures along the way. They eventually end up captive in a fighting ring, but escape in the end with their goods.
