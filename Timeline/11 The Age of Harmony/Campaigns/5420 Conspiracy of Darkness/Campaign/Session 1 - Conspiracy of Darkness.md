The campaign begins a week into their journey. The five mages are camping in the desert of Az Kumal. 

They've been there for the last few days, using up food and water. Trapped in shifting dunes, walking in circles. Marching in the twilight to avoid the heat of the day and cold of the night.

As day begins to come. 
Kaelith and Xalvor pour over texts, attempting to discover where they are and how to get un-lost. They are searching for a particular marker-stone to help figure out the location of Ashkara Thul.

As they travel, Kaelith and Saria talk. They met at the beginning of the mission, and have become loose friends. Neither of them trust the Sol'karis fully, and both believe it has hidden secrets, and that the order knows more about the mission than it is telling.

Dren, marching behind them, is troubled. Vorlin tries to take advantage of this turmoil to befriend him and make an ally of Dren, but something about Vorlin makes Dren uneasy.

Xalvor joins Kaelith and Saria to talk about the course, saying that it may be more accurate to steer a different way, refuting Kaelith's analysis of the passage and the spell. Kaelith rebuffs him.

They continue down Kaelith's path and find themselves more lost, and surrounded by Sand Wraiths. Xalvor uses his knowledge of sand wraiths to keep them at bay, but Saria sets them off when one gets too close. Kaelith, Dren, and Saria fight the sand wraiths while Xalvor tries to stop them and Vorlin hangs back in safety. The party ends up retreating.

After returning to the march, Kaelith reluctantly admits that his original calculations may have been off. The winds of the desert are shifting the dunes too quickly, making their maps unreliable.

Xalvor tries to divine the future, but again, his vision is obscured. He sees only the Abyss of Tartarus.

The party, lost, stumbles onto a half-buried ruin. Kaelith and Xalvor want to investigate. Saria doesn't really understand the interest, and Dren is neutral, simply being weary and tired. Vorlin is furious, demanding they go on. Kaelith insults him, the two nearly begin fighting as Saria watched, entertained, and Dren and Xalvor pulls them apart.

The party decides to camp there for the day. Kaelith and Xalvor begin sifting through the ruins, and are joined by Saria. Using the writings they find, they reorient themselves on the map, realising they were way off from where they thought they were. 

Kaelith is interested by the writings and the ruins. Saria encourages Kaelith to keep looking, entertained by his excitement. Everyone else is in their tents, sleeping. 

The two find an enterance and try to open it, ignoring the sealing glyphs that act as a warning.

UnSealing the enterance, they're attacked by a mummy. It sets the sandstorms against them as it fights. Waking up the others, the five defeat the mummy.

With the corrected course, they set out the next dusk. They find it quickly.

Xalvor studies the markings and writing, translating it into broken Chiss. It's a warning, and a riddle leading to Ashkara Thul.

They spot someone running away from the party.
