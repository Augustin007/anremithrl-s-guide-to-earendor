[[Session 2 - Conspiracy of Darkness |<-prev]]
Dren uses the cultist's robes to pretend to be a cultist and introduces the other four as brand new initiates. They are taken to the new groups of initiates.

At every turn, they realise the cult has a lot more magic and wealth at its disposal than they thought. It's a lot more organised, powerful, and prepared than they would have thought.

The four try to talk amongst themselves, with Vorlin arguing that they should lay low and start the initiation process and not do anything rash. Saria disagrees, saying they should attack the leaders of the operation. Kaelith ends up siding with Vorlin, to Saria's disappointment. 

Kaelith and Vorlin decide to conceal themselves and attempt a reconnaisance mission to find out more. Xalvor and Saria are spotted, and sent to question and execute a prisoner.

Xalvor questions the man, discovering him to be a member of the Sol'karis, and that he had been there when Mira was attacked. He confirms that Mira is dead. In a brief moment they get alone, Xalvor admits he is from the Sol'karis and offers to help him. Saria is enraged and tells Xalvor they can't. Shortly after, they are given the order to perform the execution. Xalvor blanches and refuses, about to start a confrontation, and Saria executes the man.

Meanwhile, Kaelith and Vorlin meet up with Dren. They agree to try to get closer to the pyramid. At one point, they watch a cult leader enter the pyramid, and they follow and sneak around and come across the sarcophogus. Kaelith touches the Sarcophogus and has a vision of Hechilspet escaping.

They hear rumours of a supplier and patron.

Further spying reveals that the dig is meant to uncover pieces of a ritual, and that the cult needs only one more to undo the bindings of the prison.

The group reuinites. Xalvor's hesitation puts them all under suspicion, and Vorlin sides with Saria against him, while Dren defends Xalvor. Kaeleth talks about his own shadowed past, studying forbidden texts, and wonders whether Xalvor might be the best of them, for not being tempted by power.

In the night, Kaeleth sees a vision of Hechilspet speaking to him, offering him power and knowledge, telling him his perception of Hechilspet is flawed.
As Kaeleth talks more and more with Hechilspet, he believes he can grant Hechilspet enough freedom to keep him satiated, and believes Hechilspet is truly remorseful. His curiousity peaqued, he agrees to talk with Hechilspet more.
