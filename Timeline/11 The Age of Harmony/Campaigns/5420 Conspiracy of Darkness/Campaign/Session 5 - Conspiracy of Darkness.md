[[Session 4 - Conspiracy of Darkness |<-prev]]
As they are being marched back, Dren defends Vorlin's actions to Saria in whispers. Saria blows him off, but respects that he had the werewithal to lie, saying that though Xalvor would be displeased, it was very much necessary.

Dren and Vorlin talk. Vorlin, further up in the cult now, reveals that he has discovered they have a patron, an unknown figure who has provided them with resources, magic, and knowledge lost to time. Dren attempts to discover who it is.

Dren fails to discover what it is, and tries to communicate back with the Sol'karis, to urge them to send support now. No answer comes. 

Vorlin learns more about the cult, and about Tartarus and the Second Sundering, and decides he is glad he is on the winning side. He urges Dren to give up the quest for the Sol'karis.

Saria is interrogated, and during the interrogation, she manages to get her hands on some water and a cup. She brings out a concealed pouch of poison, and poisons the cup unnoticed, and demands to speak to Vorlin.

Dren sneaks into the area with the Sarcophagus. He attempts to destroy it, but is stopped by Kaelith, who emerges from the shadows. Kaelith explains his idea, to commune with Hechilspet, to learn from him, and Hechilspet can kill the cultists for them. He explains how the god has turned, and is no longer the evil tyrant he was in the past. There is a strange light in Kaelith's eyes. Dren leaves him be.

Dren attempts to go talk to Saria, but is stopped.

Vorlin goes to see Saria, her cup is right there. She drinks from the cup once. She explains that she respects his position and why he did what he did. Her own movements were rash. Vorlin explains that she can very well excape alive if she offers herself to him. She agrees, and offers him a toast in agreement. Since they only have one cup, she says they'll both have to drink of it. She drinks first and then watches Vorlin drink. They both die within minutes.

Dren ponders everything when he hears of the deaths of Saria and Vorlin. He is taken with the rest of the cult to begin performing the final ritual. As the ritual begins, he gets close to the high-priest with a knife and attempts to assasinate him, but is stopped by Kaelith. The cultists drag Dren down, but he challenges Kaelith, using his ego against him, and Kaelith agrees to fight him one on one. Dren barely holds his own against Kaelith, and Kaelith toys with him. Dren can see remnants of magical charms and enchantments on Kaelith's mind, and attempts to dispel them, but is not powerful enough. 

Kaelith and Dren devolve into shouting at each other, over which Dren reveals Saria is dead. This shakes Kaelith, weakening the hold of the spell, and Dren is now able to dispel it. 

 They are too late, and Hechilspet emerges from the Sarcophagus. The two turn and kill the high-priests before turning on Hechilspet. Hechilspet fights them 'as a mortal should', without magic and using only his skill and his blade, killing them both after a short duel.
