For Crag.

Alphytes (A political party following the dead Alphy, a once-advisor of Colossus who advised following Auril in the previous campaign.) begin to rise, causing more problems. Crag has to lead dangerous missions to try to search for food and supplies in the cold. 

Focus on Crag's day-to-day challenges in Gnomes'helm. The scarcity of food, the biting cold, and the fear gripping his people. Show his struggle to maintain order, his attempts to inspire hope, and his efforts to protect the town from both external threats and internal despair.

Highlight the emotional and physical toll on Crag and his guards. Describe the harshness of their duties, the sacrifices they make, and the moments of warmth and camaraderie that keep them going.


Galio:

Develop the soldier he saved, and build camaraderie between them as they return to camp. Galio was appointed Supreme General of the NAF forces because he was the best. He had an impressive number of victories to his name from previous campaigns. This has crushed him. He sees how he panicked over losing a war of attrition and failed to consider enemy intelligence far outweighed his own. He had known the odds were overwhelming, but now they are even more so. This is a pivotal moment for Galio to grow. He must learn to cope with his failures, to rally his spirits, and to devise a new strategy against the overwhelming odds. He is a two-day journey away from main camp.

Colossus & William:
I mostly have them figured out, but I do want to bring more attention to the six Dragons that have been gathering in Deathwood. Galio fought one of these, and nearly died, but they do eventually have to get stopped, which is the plan for act III, and I want to start laying the groundwork.
