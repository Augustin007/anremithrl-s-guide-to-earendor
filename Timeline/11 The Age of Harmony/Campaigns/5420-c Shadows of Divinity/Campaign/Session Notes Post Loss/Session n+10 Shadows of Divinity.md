Krag fights and loses against the greenclad, who carve out Aric's eye. They take him to the Pit of the Darkness that Is, who believes Krag is Talos. As they are being threatened, Krag threatens to toss a wonderous item to the Darkness, but they decide he is bluffing. He breaks the item, and the darkness swallows it, killing the other greenclad and taking the items. Three goats come and take the children away.

Krag leaves, and he hears the Darkness awaken, and sees it.

"Thank you Talos. I will not forget it."
