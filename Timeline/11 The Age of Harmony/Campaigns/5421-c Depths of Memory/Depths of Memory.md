# **The Sunken Realms of Eärendor: A World Beyond Comprehension**

> _"The sky is a dead thing. The land is a wound. Only the water sings."_  
> —Tideborn Songkeeper

To those who dwell beneath the waves, the **Sunken Realms** are the only true world. **The surface is a myth, a place of death, alien and unnatural.** Land is a wound in the ocean, a place where water clings to flesh in grotesque ways, where breath is thin and burning, and where the sky stretches into **a void with no end**.

In contrast, **to the land-dwellers**, the ocean is a **gaping abyss**. An unknowable depth filled with monsters that **lurk unseen beneath the waves**, reaching up to **pull the unwary into a slow, suffocating death**.

This is more than fear. It is **fundamental incomprehension**. **Merfolk and landfolk do not simply live in different environments—they exist in different realities.**

## **A Mind Unlike Any Other: The Alien Psychology of the Merfolk**

The **people of the deep** are not like those who walk the land. They do not **think** as landfolk do. They do not **hear** as landfolk do. They do not even **perceive time and reality** in the same way.

---

### **1. The Language of Lightning**

Sound, as land-dwellers understand it, **barely travels through water**. While surface-dwellers rely on **airborne vibrations**, **merfolk have no concept of sound as landfolk know it**. Instead, they communicate through a form of **bioelectric pulses**, a **language of light and current** that only others of their kind can truly perceive.

A merfolk's **bioelectric field** functions as both **a voice and a sixth sense**, allowing them to:

- **Transmit complex thoughts instantly** through pulses of electricity.
- **Sense movement** in the water **like a predator sensing prey.**
- **"Hear" emotions directly**—the **stronger** a thought or feeling, the **brighter** the pulse.
- **Understand history through touch**, reading ancient bioelectric signatures left in coral, bones, or ruins.

To them, **land-dweller speech is incomprehensible.** They do not hear it. They do not process it. The idea of **words made from noise** is an absurdity, a bizarre surface-dweller affliction.

🔹 **This has made direct communication impossible.**  
🔹 **Language spells fail completely.** Land-dweller minds do not have the organs to **receive** merfolk pulses, and merfolk do not have ears to process **spoken** language.

---

### **2. The Song of the Drowned**

> _"It is not for you. You were never meant to hear it."_  
> —Abyssal Oracle

Yet, there is one kind of sound the merfolk have **perfected**—a haunting, resonant **song** that travels through water and calls across vast distances.

But this song is not for merfolk. It is for the **land-dwellers.**

Unlike their **electric voices**, the Song of the Drowned is an **ancient biological adaptation**, an instinctive lure meant to **draw prey into the sea**. **To landfolk, it is haunting, beautiful—irresistible.** They follow the music into the deep, never realizing **they cannot breathe the water until it is too late**.

Some scholars believe the song is **older than the merfolk themselves**, a gift—or a curse—from **Istishia**, the thoughtless primordial who birthed them. Others believe it is something **far worse**, an echo of the **first music**, the song of the Epic Dragons, still lurking in the deepest waters.

🔹 **To this day, sailors whisper of "the sirens"—but they do not know the half of it.**  
🔹 **To the merfolk, it is not music. It is hunting.**

---

### **3. Memory is the True Currency**

Landfolk build **libraries, records, and archives** to preserve knowledge. But in the deep, such things are **impossible**. Water erodes, currents scatter, ink dissolves.

Instead, the merfolk **record history in living coral**, in great bioluminescent structures called **Wells of the Lost Tides**. These reefs **store electric pulses of memory**, glowing with the thoughts and experiences of generations past.

When a merfolk **dies**, their final thoughts are left behind in these Wells. Those who touch them can **see flashes of history**, experience old battles, hear forgotten warnings.

But the Wells are not eternal. They **fade** over time, rewritten by new thoughts, new stories.

🔹 **The past is fragile.**  
🔹 **Memory is currency.**  
🔹 **Those who control the Wells control history itself.**

---

## **A World Without Walls: The Cultures of the Deep**

The Sunken Realms do not have **nations** as landfolk understand them. They do not build **cities**, do not forge **borders**. Instead, their world is shaped by **currents, predators, and memory.**

---

### **1. The Abyssal Lords – Keepers of the Black Archives**

> _"The world before the gods still exists. We simply keep it hidden."_

Deep in the **Midnight Trenches**, the Abyssal Lords rule over **the Black Archives**, an impossible structure buried so deep that **not even light** can reach it. Here, they hoard knowledge **too dangerous to be spoken, too terrible to be forgotten**.

Unlike the merfolk, the Abyssal Lords **can communicate with land-dwellers**—but they refuse to. To them, the surface is **a dying world**, a mistake **too young to matter**. They **erase** history not out of malice, but because they believe they **alone** understand what is coming.

🔹 **They do not rule. They control.**  
🔹 **They do not invade. They erase.**  
🔹 **No one truly knows what they are waiting for.**

---

### **2. The Tideborn – Nomads of the Open Waters**

> _"The land is dead. The sky is hollow. We are the only ones who endure."_

The **Tideborn** do not build. They do not stay. They **move with the waters**, following ancient paths known only to their people. Their elders are called **Waykeepers**, those who remember **the songs of the currents**.

They are the only merfolk who **believe in the land**, but to them, it is **a place of exile, of sickness, of those who will never return**.

🔹 **They believe the Abyssal Lords are hiding something.**  
🔹 **They whisper of an ancient betrayal.**  
🔹 **They claim the world is ending—not in fire, but in rising tides.**

---

### **3. The Forsaken – The Ones Who Walked on Land**

> _"They left. And they are not welcome back."_

Once, there were merfolk who **walked upon the land**. Not as invaders, but as **exiles**—cast out, forgotten.

To the merfolk, they are **traitors**. To the Abyssal Lords, they are **a mistake**.

Some say they still **exist**. That they have changed. That they are **waiting to return.**

🔹 **No merfolk will speak of them.**  
🔹 **No Wells hold their memories.**  
🔹 **But their Song still lingers.**

---

## **The Greatest Secret: The Land and Sea Were Never Separate**

> _"You think the sea is below you. That the land is above. But you do not understand."_

There is one final truth that neither the merfolk nor the landfolk understand.

Once, long before the Sundering War, before the gods carved the world into pieces, before the land rose and the sea fell—**the land and the ocean were the same**.

Somewhere in the abyss, beneath the Midnight Trenches, **there is a place where they still meet.**

🔹 **The Abyssal Lords know.**  
🔹 **The Tideborn fear it.**  
🔹 **And something that was buried is waking up.**

## **Final Themes of the Sunken Realms**

✅ **The Ocean is the True World** – Land is an illusion, an accident.  
✅ **Magic is Unstable** – The currents disrupt all spells, shaping an entirely different way of life.  
✅ **Understanding is Impossible** – Language, thought, and perception are utterly alien between land and sea.  
✅ **Something is Coming** – The old knowledge is returning. And the ocean will remember.

# **The World Beneath the Waves: The Sunken Realms of Eärendor**

The **sunken world** of Eärendor is a vast and alien domain, a place where **civilization clings to the depths** but is dwarfed by the **untamed wilds of the abyss**. To the land-dwellers, the ocean is an afterthought—an expanse to sail across, or a boundary between continents. To those who live beneath it, however, it is **a world without borders**, an eternal battleground between **ancient horrors, shifting currents, and fragile, struggling societies**.

### **A World of Isolation & Fear**

The **currents of the deep** are **anti-magic zones**, where spells fail, enchanted artifacts grow dull, and the natural flow of mana is disrupted. This has **stunted magical development** beneath the waves, leaving only those gifted with **innate magic**—sorcerers, bloodline casters, and the rarest of clerics—to wield true power. Even these gifted few must be careful, for the currents can **strip them of their magic**, leaving them defenseless against the horrors that lurk in the abyss.

This has also made **communication with the surface nearly impossible**—no spells of sending, no easy scrying, no written tomes of arcane knowledge passed down. Instead, knowledge is preserved **through song, oral traditions, and the bioluminescent Wells of the Lost Tides**—coral structures that glow with the memories of ages past.

While some surface dwellers whisper of **merfolk and strange, nameless deep-dwellers**, few have ever truly made contact. The distrust is mutual—those of the deep call land-dwellers **"air-thieves"** and **"stone-blind"**, considering them ignorant creatures who think the world ends at the shoreline.

## **The Major Powers of the Deep**

Unlike the surface, the sea does **not belong to civilization**, but to **wilderness**. True kingdoms are **few and scattered**, existing in fragile harmony—or bitter rivalry—with the vast, unknowable **Abyss** that lurks below.

---

### **The Abyssal Lords – Rulers of the Forgotten Depths**

> _"Knowledge is the only light in the darkness. And we will be the ones to hold it."_  
> —Duke Uthexx, Lord of the Black Archives

Beneath the trenches of the world lie the **Abyssal Lords**, a shadowy **scholocracy** that rules over the deepest reaches of the ocean. They do not govern with armies, nor do they claim vast territories. Instead, they rule **through silence, through secrets, through control**.

To them, **knowledge is power**, and their vast **Black Archives** are said to contain **truths long erased from history**—records of the First Gods, the **last words of the Epic Dragons**, and **spells stolen from surface-dweller minds**. These archives, hidden in **the Midnight Catacombs**, are said to be **sealed away from all but the Lords themselves**.

Though no mortal dares to name them all, the greatest of these rulers are:

- **Duke Uthexx, the Cold Scholar** – A ruthless mind-weaver who can extract knowledge through sheer presence.
- **Lady Merithis, Keeper of the Last Door** – Said to guard a ruin **older than the gods** themselves.
- **The Dreamless One** – A nameless, faceless entity that speaks through the currents, offering whispers of the past.

The **Abyssal Lords do not wage wars**, but they **do not tolerate dissent**. Those who defy them are **silenced**—their memories stolen, their names erased from coral-song, their very existence forgotten.

---

### **The Tideborn – Nomads of the Open Waters**

> _"The sea has no walls, no chains, no cages. We are the tide, and we will always return."_  
> —Naliath of the Wandering Reefs

In contrast to the Abyssal Lords, the **Tideborn** are the **nomads of the sea**, traveling along **sacred currents** in great, **living caravans** of whales, seabeasts, and floating reef-vessels.

They do not build cities—instead, they **sing their history** into the Wells of the Lost Tides, bioluminescent coral formations that store the **memories of their people**.

They follow an unbroken path, dictated by **ancient songs**, guiding them along safe waters and away from **the great beasts of the abyss**. These songs are **passed down through generations**, and a Tideborn who cannot sing their lineage is no Tideborn at all.

They believe the surface world is **half-real**, a place where the sky is a false ceiling and the people are **blind to the true depth of the world**. Their words for land-dwellers translate roughly to **"children of the shallows"**, or, more insultingly, **"dead before drowning"**.

#### **The Great Pods of the Tideborn**

- **The Moon-Wake Tribe** – Known for their **wayfinders**, who can read the stars from beneath the waves.
- **The Stormcallers** – Protectors of the sea, wielding **whale-song magic** to control tides and creatures.
- **The Silent Drift** – A lost tribe, said to have vanished without a trace. Some say they are still out there, drifting in the Abyss.

Some Tideborn believe **the Abyssal Lords are hiding something**, that they hoard knowledge **too dangerous to be known**. Others claim the Lords are simply **buying time, delaying something inevitable**—a **reckoning that will come from the sea itself**.

---

### **The Drowned Kingdom of Othyris**

> _"What was lost shall rise again."_  
> —Inscription at the Gates of Othyris

Once, the city of **Othyris** was the **greatest civilization of the deep**—a **fortress of coral spires**, shining with **a hundred bioluminescent towers**, its people masters of both craft and war.

Now, **it is a graveyard.**

Othyris was lost to **a great betrayal**, its rulers deceived by the **Abyssal Lords**, its walls shattered by **the return of something older than the gods**. Its people—once among the most powerful of the deep—are now **scattered**, their heritage stolen, their memory forbidden.

The **Ruins of Othyris** are said to lie somewhere **beyond the Last Currents**, a place where no songs remain. The few who return speak of **a city still alive beneath the ruins**, its lights flickering, its halls whispering in voices that are **not quite dead**.

Some Tideborn believe **the fall of Othyris was no accident**. Some say it was the first sign of **a war yet to come**.

---

## **The Monsters of the Deep**

> _"The surface world does not know fear. It does not know what it means to be hunted."_  
> —Selir, Tideborn War-Speaker

The creatures of the deep are not **mindless beasts**—they are **remnants** of something **ancient, powerful, and wrong**.

The depths of the world lie **closer to the raw magic of Azgorath and the Epic Dragons**, and the creatures that dwell there have been **twisted by the echoes of a time before gods**.

Some of these include:

- **The Leviathans of the Hollow Trench** – Great, serpentine horrors that feed not on flesh, but **on memory itself**.
- **The False Ones** – Creatures that mimic the forms of lost loved ones, whispering in voices that are _almost_ right.
- **The Unshackled** – Beasts with **the remnants of divine ichor**, cursed with immortality, left to wander the depths forever.

For the people of the deep, **there is no “safe land.”** There is only **survival, or oblivion**.

---

### **Final Notes: Themes of the Sunken World**

- **A world of silence & secrets** – Knowledge is power. Magic is fragile.
- **Survival is fleeting** – The sea is not conquered. It is endured.
- **Ancient things stir** – The past is not buried. It is waiting.
