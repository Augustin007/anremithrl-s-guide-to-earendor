Dareth convinces Caxius to stay with the group as they travel, as it is safer than risking the Cult of the Whispered One catching them seperately. The thirteen people begin traveling to the nearest city, Carabran, where Ranor will get the last ingredients for the antidote and then they'll leave the underdark, though both Ranor and Caxius have some plans of staying.

On the way, they are attacked by some Drow slavers, but they outnumber them, thirteen to five, and the slavers flee. In this confrontation, Caxius breaks her chain which holds her amulet with a picture of her brother. She stuffs it in her pocket.

When they reach the city, they divide into three groups to avoid attracting too much attention. They intend to meet up at a bell tower on the other side.

Ranor, Caxius, Krag (in the mirror), and Dareth enter first. They are mind blanked, and all are targets of the Cult, (no point in risking the other groups.) Besides, the other nine have travelled together before, and also, with Krag in the mirror, the other three are the most stealthy.

They are still spotted by a member of the cult, who goes to warn the others. At around that time, Lord Szinvorn Dyrrith passes by. Caxius realises he looks very much like her brother.

At about that time, group two goes in. Naras is leading, and Aric insisted on going with Naras, he is carrying Kerran and holding onto Lirien. Syl is accompanying.

They are clearly outsiders and are stopped by some thugs who try to rob them. Three Druegar, one Drow, and one Orc-Troll. The leader, the drow, slices into the bag of holding, puncturing it. 

This leads to an explosion. The various items they had put in there, and the things Tal'berius had put, fly out, many of their magical effects are triggered. Black antimagic lightning destroys six of the spheres and dispells any remaining magic on them, the resulting explosion kills one of the Druegar and the drow, as well as several people across the street as various buildings collapse. Syl is expelled to the Shadowfell.

In the ensuing panic, Caxius loses track of the lord, and separates from Ranor and Dareth to shadow one of his guards. They do not try to stop her.

Talor hears the explosion and takes off with Serin, Torquil, and Liriel. He sees area of the explosion and the Orc dragging away Kerran and Lirien, and he kills the Orc-troll with an arrow, and one of the Druegar, but the last druegar survives and flees. They try to grab as much as they can from the bag and take off as police start arriving.

Caxius follows him into the Dyrric Palace, and infiltrates the outer curtain, but the inner curtain of the palace is too well defended. Out of options, she enters the outer-guard barracks and ambushes a soldier in the communal bathroom, killing him and inscribing _Rache_ (Traitor) in the Thieves' cant, to throw off investigation. She takes his gambeson and calmly walks out and begins washing her hands, where she meets Arbach, (Pronounced a bit like Ehdbak). She says she's new and was hired by 'the lord'. He seems quite impressed, and asks how she managed to attract the attention of the lord and yet ended up in the outer guard. She says she chose it.

Ranor gets separated from Dareth. He reaches the bell tower, a part of an old Raven Wing church, and considers abandoning everyone else, but he convinces himself that they saved his life so he owes them this. It is the 'right' thing to do. Something that as a drow he didn't really grow up having a concept of. He uses divination to find out what the others are doing.

There is a gnome skeleton, wearing garbs of a cleric of the Raven's Wings, pinned to the ruins of the church.

Talor, Torquil, Naras, Liriel, Lirien, Serin, Kerran, and Aric reach the bell tower. Ranor berates Naras for drawing so much attention to himself.

56/115 - Ranor
