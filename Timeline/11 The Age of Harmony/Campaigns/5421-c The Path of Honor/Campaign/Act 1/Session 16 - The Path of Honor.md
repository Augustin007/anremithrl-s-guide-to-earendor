[[Session 15 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Caxius attempts to escape with Talor. They steal the keys and choke a guard until he passes out, killing the other by setting him on fire. Caxius sets clothes on fire to be a distraction, pretending to be on fire. Caxius is shot by Charged Electric Antimagic Quarrels as she rushes the rest of the guards, Talor, seeing her fall, takes Torquil and runs deeper into the labyrinth-prison past guards, relying on size and speed, until he reaches abandoned caves. 

Caxius lays on the cold stone floor, remembering her brother, until she gives a final shudder and dies.

Syl wakes Naras because she sees guards dragging away Liriel. Naras considers different ways of attacking, with Syl, he figures out and uses the figurine of a golden canary taken from Dareth, speaking the words spoken to him by Fizban the night before. "Sckeeo teners ou pethleen thlon". The Canary turns into a golden dragon that kills the police, and Naras reaches Liriel.

Talking with Liriel, he finds out Serin was captured first, she gave herself up so that Liriel could escape hours ago, while Naras was sleeping, and he still has no sign of Krag, Ranor, Aric, Lirien, and Kerran.
