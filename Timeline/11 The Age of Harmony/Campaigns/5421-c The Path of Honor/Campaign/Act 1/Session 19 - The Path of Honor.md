[[Session 18 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Ivvan, Naras, and Liriel try to work out how to get past the blade barriers.

Torquil passes out as the rats fail and a dark blast of somethingness passes over him from a Serin-wards direction.

Drithen frees Duthrim, and a pair of Psionic Fae Verdan twins who steal his keys and baton and disappear. 
Torquil and Talor stabalise and are woken up by the Verdan, who have a dancing dragon tatoo between the two.
Guards are asleep. Slowly the defences fall. Prisoners are escaping. Behind them, there is a huge carnage, Serin has somehow gotten to the same side of the barrier to them. They grab as much gear as they can and take off, bumping into an also escaping Naras and Ivvan, and Drithen and Duthrim, and Liriel. The eight of them go to Vraelis's bar and hunker down, drinking, tending to their wounds, sorting through their gains, and resting in hiding. 

Liriel is shocked by the carnage at the prison. Serin is even quieter than before. Liriel tries to buy a knife before Naras gives her one and promises to teach her.
