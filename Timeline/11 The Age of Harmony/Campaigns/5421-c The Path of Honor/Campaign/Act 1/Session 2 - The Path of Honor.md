[[Session 1 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

Searching for some haven from the storm after the Earthquake, Syl, Talor, Naras, and Ahktos stumble too near to the Necromancer and Syl gets captured by his wards. They fight an undead Thalai, resurrected as a wailing revenant, finally working together, and free Syl, unknowingly leaving a trace on themselves.
They flee the necromancer and wind up in the village of Caradhas, which was crushed by the snow from the hills around it.
