[[Session 20 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

The party decides not to back to the Underdark to look for the dwarf Duthrim. Aric has an open wound on his face, and has lost an eye, Liriel is trying to help him bandage the eye. The child, Kerran, is now very pale and barely breathing. Lirien is carrying him, asking the party for help, but they can do nothing about it.  *The only person with a healing potion is Naras, who doesn't want to give it up*. Aric seems shaken, and no longer seems to idolise Naras. Naras checks the gear he stole from Dareth's body, finding a sword of life stealing. Naras makes a grave for Uncim in the snow. Aric insists that the group look for something to help Kerran. Tearing off with his brother, while Ivvan and Talor go to help.

In the nearby city, once known as Hreghalk, and since the conquest by Remshi, known as Lei'ca, King Tar'id'lion'nil Remshi, shortened to Tarnil, known as the avenger, who was legitimised after Nugget's death, and named the true heir, and those who were loyal to his succession, have fled after a coup by the council (which Faust saw at the capital.) They have a small encampment, which is struggling for food, and arguing with the locals.

His scouts hear of some people matching the description of a report of terrorists from the Underdark, and he orders them captured and brought to him.

There is a creature that calls itself 'Giggles' in these woods. Giggles is being guided by someone he calls 'The Voice'. This voice told him weeks ago that he would find the fate his former circus friend Uncim. Lirien stumbles into Giggles and Giggles threatens him for information on Uncim. Aric, hearing the shriek that his brother made of terror, rushes there and attacks the clown. Talor arrives next and stops Aric from killing the clown, and begins to interrogate him.

At this point, the Dragonborn soldiers arrive to arrest them. They all choose to go peacefully except Giggles, who attacks the guards and is easily restrained.

They get taken before the King Tarnil, who questions them. Giggles casts a cantrip to make a really bad smell while being rude. Casting a spell gives him a chance to be possessed by His Voice. Which happens. The Praetoriate Guard of Remshi ushers the king to safety, and attacks him alongside the party, he easily bests them until he takes psychic damage and is restored. 

While possessed, Giggles's consiousness was in another plane, in which he spoke to The Voice. The Voice told him that Naras stole something that belonged to the Voice, and that Naras also killed Uncim. He should try to join the party and take his revenge, to benefit both of them.

When Giggles regains control and is apprehended, the king plans to execute giggles, and seeing that the party helped defend against Giggles, and protected his guards and him, he intends to let them free after questioning, but during the questioning Torquil argues in defense of Giggles, explaining that he saw that Giggles was possessed by a spirit with his Divine Sight. And that it would not be fair to execute Giggles for a crime he didn't commit. Tar'id'lion'nil continues his questioning and figures out who Naras Vorasthar and guesses Ivvan's heritage. When the questioning is finished, Giggles is brought before him. Giggles begs for mercy, and is exiled until he finds a cure.
