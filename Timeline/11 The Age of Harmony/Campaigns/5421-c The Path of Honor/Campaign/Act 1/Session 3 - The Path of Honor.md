[[Session 2 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

As Talor leaves to hunt, Naras and Ahktos dislike each other even more. Syl catches an intellect devourer coming towards them, and advises them to flee. 
Strange divination magic seems to permeate things they are doing. Naras suspects his sister.
Ahktos gets ahead and arrives at a small village that's been affected by the blizzard and earthquake. He starts trying to steal from it.
Naras flees the devourer and runs into an owlbear. He stays very still and it leaves him alone. Naras uses up some of his order to fly to the next village.
