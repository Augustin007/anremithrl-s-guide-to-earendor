[[Session 7 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

The seven reach the city.
One of the kids knows a bit of Khuzdul and helps them get in. This is the older girl. She appears talkative and bright, with sudden bouts of silence.
After entering the city, Talor and Naras talk about the future of the kids. The dwarves don't like strangers and they probably won't be treated well in the city, and this close to the wrath of Auril it isn't much more dangerous for the kids to follow them. They don't want to let the kids decide because they are too young, but they do ask the kids their preference. The four-year-old boy is asleep. They talk to the kids a bit. The older girl introduces herself as Liriel Danstal, the thirteen-year-old daughter of a librarian, and top of her class. The older boy is Aric Vael, he's fourteen, and his little brother Lirien Vael is six. The other girl who looks to be about eight, hasn't spoken a word the entire time, but when asked her name, she uttered a single word, "Serin". Aric and Liriel both agree that staying with Naras seems safer to them. The children are all fairly sullen and traumatised because of the destruction of their city and the murder of everyone they know.
They buy some equipment and set up in two rooms at an inn. Torquil Leogan excites and befriends Liriel. Aric is entirely devoted to his brother, having carried him all the way through the city. 
The oldest boy, Aric Vael, reveals himself to be very protective of his younger brother, trying to find out what is going on, trying to make a plan. His younger brother, the six year old Lirien Vael, has complete faith in his older brother and adores him, and trusts no one other than his brother, and doesn't want to be separated from them. 
Aric is willing to fight and to die for his brother and generally seems to have these high standards of honour.
Aric asks Naras to teach him how to fight to protect his brother.
The first night Naras saw Aric comforting Lirien because of the loss of their home and family until Lirien fell asleep, and Aric fell asleep sitting up still holding his brother.
Liriel Danstal doesn't let the others see her cry and mostly seems to be bottling up her emotions about all of it. She likes learning and does take an interest in learning alchemy from Torquil. She was crying at night while Torquil was keeping watch. When he asked if she was alright she shoved him away.
The eight year old doesn't sleep and doesn't blink. She only said one word, "Serin". She seems strangely attached to Talor of the three adults. She seems mostly listless and depressed and quiet, though she did wordlessly comfort the four year old boy when he woke up for a bit.  Serin speaks a tiny bit more, stating that she doesn't sleep. She is peredhel, the others guess, a human with a little bit of elvish in her blood.
The four year old wakes up the next morning, and is fairly talkative, but soon starts getting sick again. His name is Kerran. He seems attached to Torquil.
They buy some more equipment, seeing a canary follow them.
