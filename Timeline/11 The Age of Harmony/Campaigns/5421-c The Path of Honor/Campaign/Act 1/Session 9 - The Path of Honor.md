[[Session 8 - The Path of Honor|<- Prev]]

And they keep on seeing a canary or two following them as they buy supplies and stuff.
Then three.
Then four.
Eventually they see seven canaries. Torquil, spooked, attacks one and is stopped by a man in green robes with golden runes, a black wizard's hat, a silver scarf, and a golden sash. The seven canaries settle on the man.
He beats Torquil, and separates him from the group. The others wisely decide not to touch the Canaries.
They talk to people and solve a puzzle and reach the [[Underdark]], as the seven canaries each seem to take an interest in one of them.
They're worried about this, but there's nothing to be done about it.
Talor leaves the group to fetch some supplies and they don't notice when he doesn't return until they are about to enter the Underdark.
They search for him, and the at some point Serin disappears when they aren't paying attention.
They regroup at the entrance, with Naras, when they are attacked by a pair of drow. The drow put everyone to sleep except Naras, who barely manages to kill one of them, but the other gets away with a captive Lirien.
He chases after Lirien but there is only a dead Drow, Lirien and his canary are gone.
He returns and sees Liriel is missing now too.
He wakes up Aric, who demands to know where his brother is. Enraged, Aric attacks Naras and chases after his brother, disappearing into the cave.
Naras runs after them, he quickly ends up confused, separated, and in a plane of his own.
The canary transforms into a golden dragon, who shows Naras visions of his former masters when he was a slave. The ones he liked, and the ones he hated. Naras attacks the dragon and is easily stopped.
He sees the moment he is captured.
He is shown a vision of his home country being ruled by his Tyrrant sister. He shows him his abandoned throne, and the other troubles of the region. He shows his sister allying with the betrayer gods and Tartarus. He shows the rift gate to Chaos tearing into the bindings of Azgorath. 
The dragon whispers into Naras's mind. Needling him about not trying to help his people when he was there, staying away from politics when he saw all the corruption that was there and he was the one with most power to stop it. He blames Naras for the death of his older brother. Naras, enraged, attacks the dragon again, who claims Naras failed the lesson, but there will hopefully be another chance.
With Torquil, the green-robed man identifies himself as Fizban, also known as Bahamut. This is a simple projection of the god, as the tree of names has thinned, but the whole god couldn't make it. 
Torquil has information on everyone and plans on how to end up on top. And he's vital to Auril and Tartarus's plan, since he's been acting as their messenger boy very secretly, influencing the party to go to different places along the journey where he can secretly deliver messages. Bahamut walks with him into the Underdark in a small demiplane copy of the world as they talk and Bahamut attempts to extract information from him. Bahamut wants to extract a single use favour from Torquil. When Torquil agrees, he leaves.
Fizban was needling into Torquil's lack of commitment to any side and his cowardliness.
Torquil meets up with Liriel. She's distraught and screams at him for making an oath to Auril. She found out from the dragon that was with her, the dragon of secrets. She's also disappointed with him for swearing the oath to Fizban. She says that he failed the test just like her.
Torquil tries to claim it was for the sake of the party. Fizban had threatened his life during the conversation, he might have killed everyone in the party if he hadn't agreed, to which Liriel says "No, he'd only have killed you. You're the only one who deserves to die."
Naras finds Aric, who apologises and seems rather shaky, but more confident. They quickly find Lirien, who tells his brother that the bird said he failed and asks Aric where he was. Aric just holds him tightly. He says it's okay, and that he'll get another chance. They find the little boy, who is now awake and seemingly healed completely. He calls himself Kerran. 
The rest of the group reunite in the Underdark, now, somewhat lost, with the exception of Serin and Talor, which are nowhere to be found.
Liriel did not snitch on Torquil, but she is refusing to look at him.
