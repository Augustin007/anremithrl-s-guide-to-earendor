Everyone talks about what they are going to do. Naras wants to head South and tries to convince people to follow him, while Tarnil wants to head north. 

Naras finds out about the tracking spells on the Sash brands and tries to absorb the magic off of Uldren. This results in a shock wave that kills Lirien, who was drawing in the snow with Ivvan.

There's a scuffle as people blame each other and Aric attacks Naras. In the end, the party agrees and Aric and Naras are tied up while Uldren passes out. 
Syl is unsummoned.

They go to the nearest town, planning to go their seperate ways after that, only to find it abandoned and everyone dead. Attacked by spectres, they run away. Qorneth tries throwing Naras's stuff at it, resulting in him being blinded by the needle and the destruction of the prismatic cube.

Ivvan is drawing in the snow. Lirien joins him, drawing as well. Aric and Naras argue over rescuing Liriel until Naras walks off. Uldren is unbound by Qorneth while Talor and Tarnil speak. Tarnil is attempting to convince Talor to join him, offering him land, power, and riches, but Talor doesn't want any. Naras talks to Uldren and Qorneth, thinking of an experimental way to try to remove the cursed brand, Uldren decides to try it, but Qorneth, wary of experimental magic, does not. The spell goes wrong, releasing a wave of spell energy, injuring Talor and Torquil, nearly killing Uldren and Naras, and killing the child Lirien. Aric, having seen this, is overcome by grief. He attempts to kill Naras in vengeance. Naras uses Syl to stop him, but Tarnil unsummons Syl and knocks both Naras and Aric out. They use bowstring to tie together Naras's hands and feet. They travel to a nearby backwater village, as Uldren passes out as well. They find the people of the village slaughtered. Talor carries Naras and Uldren, while Tarnil caries Aric. They notice shadows moving every so often.

While Ivvan finds a small mosaic, Tarnil and Qorneth find a chest. The chest turns out to be a mimic, but they dispatch it quickly. 
As shoadows keep on moving and lights go out, the group tries to fight it. Qorneth uses Naras's backpack and bag to produce spell spheres, a needle, then a rainbow cube. As Tarnil takes the back, Qorneth uses the rainbow cube. Before he can find out what it does, he severs it by accident using the needle, knocking him out, and blinding him forever. The  box disintegrates. 
They flee from the encroaching darkness with Ivvan as a giant bird.

To add: tear drop, Aric's knives.

Tarnil broke the tear drop.
