27 - Aric
26 - Qorneth
23 - Syl
22 - Uldren
8 - Talor

3 - Ivvan



Everyone talks about what they are going to do. Naras wants to head South and tries to convince people to follow him, while Tarnil wants to head north. 

Naras finds out about the tracking spells on the Sash brands and tries to absorb the magic off of Uldren. This results in a shock wave that kills Lirien, who was drawing in the snow with Ivvan.

There's a scuffle as people blame each other and Aric attacks Naras. In the end, the party agrees and Aric and Naras are tied up while Uldren passes out. 
Syl is unsummoned.

They go to the nearest town, planning to go their seperate ways after that, only to find it abandoned and everyone dead. Attacked by spectres, they run away. Qorneth tries throwing Naras's stuff at it, resulting in him being blinded by the needle and the destruction of the prismatic cube.
