Naras Vorasthar, a prince-turned slave, and Thalai Elanthino, a soldier, plot to escape a necromancer’s dungeon. Their attempt goes awry when the fortress’s defenses activate, killing Thalai. Naras escapes with the help of Talor. They are soon joined by Ahktos, a gnome messenger.
Ahktos makes a deal with Auril and changes his name to Torquil. As they travel, they gain a clearer view of the world’s worsening state: civil unrest, slave trades, and the growing influence of dark forces. They eventually wind up in Azerim just as Tormac strikes the city. In the chaos, they rescue five orphaned children: Aric, Lirien, Liriel, Serin, and Kerran, though Kerran is severely ill.
They meet Krag and his party, delivering news from Gnomes'helm.
They wind up in the Underdark after talking with Bahamut, who Torquil makes a deal with, and the Greenclad, who Torquil also makes a deal with, and where they meet Caxius, an assasin who joins them, but she is executed by the lords of Carabran when they are captured. Instigating a prison break with new allies Drithen, Uncim, Ivvan, and Duthrim. Kerran dies to his illness and Aric loses an eye in the chaos.
After they escape the underdark, they meet Giggles the Clown and Tar'id'lion'il Remshi'ul, Nugget's brother. They are attacked by Auril and flee, but Liriel and Torquil are captured. Liriel kills Torquil at his orders.
They meet twin escaped slaves Qorneth and Uldren, and trying to undo their tracking spells, Naras causes a chain reaction which kills Lirien, turning Aric against him. The party subdues both of them.
