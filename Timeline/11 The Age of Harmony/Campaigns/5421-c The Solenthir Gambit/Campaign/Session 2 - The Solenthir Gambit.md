[[Session 1 - The Solenthir Gambit |<-prev]]

A few weeks later.

They've reached the southern tips of Drakenthorn. The sun only shows up for a few hours each day, now. There's a light snow falling. They're planning to head Northeast, travel through Karr by the Endelwine and make it to Bharam that way. 

But the snows hit a lot earlier than usual this year, and the Endelwine river is frozen up.

Deciding that the Lightwood might be a better bet, then, they travel North to Hreghalk. Tarold is wary they're likely getting too close to Auril, and warns Aemma that up until now, they've been travelling with caravans in the civilised parts of Neros. Aemma points out that she _has_ gone adventuring before, and isn't completely unexperienced.

Tarold keeps them both on high alert.

They camp before they reach Hreghalk. Tarold drills Aemma on cultures, languages, and fighting techniques for a bit, and then has her take first watch.

---
Aemma falls asleep taking watch.

Tarold wakes up. Something is echoing in his ears.

The woods are unusually quiet. He silently gets up and wakes up Aemma, telling her to keep snoring. Aemma pretends to still be asleep, turning her indignance at waking up into a perfect imitation of sleep talking.

Tarold discreetly hands Aemma her dagger. She had dropped it in her sleep.

Tarold casts anything he can without verbal components to buff the two of them.

They get attacked by a shadow monster. Tarold strikes with his greatsword, but it simply phases through. He blinks away as it attacks and swings at its neck, but it phases through again. He dodges and uses haste and blink spells to get away. Tarold attacks it with magic and identifies it as a monster of the Dark Regions. Something incredibly rare since the Age of Shadows. This makes him realise quite how much things are changing. Since neither of them have silvered weapons, Aemma's dagger is useless. He tries to shout a warning but Aemma already attacked it, and the monster turns on her, bringing her below half her negative hitpoints.

Tarold pours oil into a slit on his sword and strikes flint against the blade, setting it alight. With a blade of fire, he's able to damage the creature, though it barely overcomes the damage reduction.

Tarold throws oil all over the monster as Aemma wakes up. He tells her to light it on fire. The creature gets lit on fire and Tarold is able to finish it off. Tarold heals them both as best he can and scolds her for sleeping on watch.

He knows she's gone on two unranked missions before and wonders what the worst she'd faced before was. She reveals the worst she'd ever fought before was a single wolf who attacked her camp in Nolorei.

They agree to silver their weapons in Hreghalk. 

Tarold points out that smaller villages can't afford to silver their weapons, so though larger cities would be fine, smaller cities would be in danger. He intends to warn as many as he can.

They decide not to finish their rest and continue north to warn villages.

They pass through a village and give the warning. They don't stay very long. 

They reach Hreghalk in darkness. Aemma can't see in the dark.

[[Session 20 - The Path of Honor|Hreghalk is in ruins]]. Spikes of ice reach into the sky. The armies of Drakenthorne and the civilians are slaughtered on the ground, covered in snow. A single gnome, with the mark of Bahamut, lies in a pool of unfrozen water. No snow falls on him. A dagger in his heart. Thirty feet away, a small boy, no more than four years old.

Tarold is appalled Auril would strike this far south, and is baffled by the main forces of Drakenthorne being here, recognising the kingsguard laying slaughtered around the king's tent, but the king missing. He finds the body of Dri'ros.

Tarold keeps watch that night. He can't sleep.

"If the Frostmaiden is pillaging this far South. I doubt there's anyone left to warn."
