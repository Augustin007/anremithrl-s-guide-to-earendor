#### Summary
Tarold is an experienced member of the Rymfelli adventurer's guild who recently had to transfer to the Nerosi one. Aemma is a dropout from university who managed to get a lesser adventuring license. In order to adventure legally, Tarold must travel with someone with a Neroshi license, and Aemma needs to be someone's squire. The obvious solution is for Aemma to be Tarold's squire.
They take on a bounty to rescue the captive Solenthiri princess in the North, encountering the trail of destruction left by events in _The Path of Honor_, fighting frost-forms and wolves, and making their way to Khar.
