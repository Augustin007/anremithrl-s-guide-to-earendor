> The Eternal Wars began. In this time, primordials were unmade, scattered, and wounded. 
> 
> The scattered remnants of primordials clung to things that were and are, and created the Genasi, it is of these peoples also that the Tritons are.
> 
> In the end, the gods ruled the world. Though many say the war is not over, but only in brief interlude.

> **_The Treason of Atropus and Dur-baagal_**
> 
> Shar whispered to Atropus many things, and so subtly did she say things and ask them, that Atropus believed the ideas were his own. And his anger was kindled. Had not Asgorath and Arambar not built Planes of the Dawn? Why, then, did they not build the Planes of the Dusk? 
> 
> And he took Dur-baagal into his confidence, for the two were great friends. And when the Cosmic Twins were busy praising Nehusta and Telos, they began to destroy the work of Asgorath and Arambar. 
> 
> Atropus became the Elder Evil, and he was was the harbinger of entropy and decay, and he embodied destruction, and he consumed the Aether. And he left behind pure negative energy, and thus the Dark Regions became as they are now.
> 
> Dur-baagal, the Cold and Cruel, was the embodiment of frigid desolation. He reveled in the stillness that comes from extreme cold, a stillness that could halt even the flow of Time itself. And because of him, Time no longer flows uniformly across the planes.
> 
> And when the Cosmic Twins turned away from the works of Nehusta and Telos, and they beheld the destruction wrought upon their masterpiece, they were greatly angered. And their countenance darkened.
> 
> And they charged into the Root Hold, and they beheld Ubtao and asked him what had occurred. And Atropus and Dur-baagal heard their angry voices ring out across the Universe, and they were afraid, for they knew that their hearts and minds were lain bare for Ubtao.
> 
> But Ubtao liked neither war nor strife, for it troubled him greatly, and he lied. "I know not who would dare such a thing. What cause have we for anger, twins? That this destruction is not of good, I can tell, but which one of us is evil? Not even Tartarus, who dwells in the Abyss would do such a thing. Perhaps it was an imbalance, some accident that no one could have foreseen. It can be reforged, and stronger than before, and nothing will be lost."
> 
> And he spoke thusly, and the twins were calmed.
> 
> Atropus and Dur-baagal, afraid of the ire of the Cosmic Twins, ceased their destructive endeavors—for a time. They approached Asgorath, their hearts filled with a newfound caution. And they did what they should have done at first. "Would you not craft for us realms of our own, as you have done for the Primordials of Dawn?" they inquired.
> 
> But Asgorath was not easily deceived. He had begun to suspect the two, and he denied them their request. And after they left he spoke to his brother, and they pieced together what had occurred. And Atropus and Dur-baagal fled.
> 
> But their malevolence was rekindled, for they were angered, but they were still afraid. Because of their anger, they listened to Shar as she whispered in their minds that they would need allies if they were to rebel.
> 
> And the two malevolent Primordials sought an audience with Telos and Nehusta, and asked for their aid. And Telos and Nehusta listened but committed to nothing, their hearts wary, for they were content. Both were builders and their hearts were turned away from destruction.
> 
> Asgorath and Arambar spoke first to their elemental siblings, in their own planes, and told them of what happened. And though Kossuth would stand with them, the rest were unmoved. 
> 
> And it was in this time that the malevolent Primordials plotted their open dissent. 
> 
> Atropus, stayed alone in the dark regions, plotting. And he did not seek out Ubtao, for he knew Ubtao heard all, "Would you have your lies exposed to Asgorath and Arambar?" he whispered, "aid me in secret, and the war shall be swift and your deceit shall remain hidden."
> 
> Meanwhile, Dur-baagal, the Cold and Cruel, ventured into the Abyss to seek an audience with Tartarus. "Join us," he urged, "and the planes shall be reshaped for the Dusk!"
> 
> Tartarus, who had long stood by Shar and orchestrated this war, pretended to have slowly been swayed by Dur-baagal's words. And he agreed. With Tartarus on their side, Atropus and Dur-baagal were emboldened, for he was a Primordial of great power, and many thought he was more powerful than even the Cosmic Twins.
> 
> ***The Eternal Wars***
> 
> And the Eternal Wars erupted like a tempest, a maelstrom of clashing elements and conflicting wills. Atropus, the Elder Evil, and Dur-baagal, the Cold and Cruel, led their rebellion. The Children of the Dusk were the first to be thrown into the fray. They were pawns, expendable and numerous, sent to wreak havoc upon the elemental planes and the Ethereal Plane.
> 
> And in the first fray the rebellion was victorious. Atropus and Dur-baagal, once united in their malevolence, found themselves at odds over the spoils of their conquests.
> 
> Asgorath and Arambar were outnumbered and unprepared, and Kossuth came to their aid to late, and only was able to help them flee. And they fled to their father, beyond the Universe, and began to plan their return.
> 
> But their plans were in unnecessary, Dur-baagal himself wrought the end of his short-lived victory. For Dur-baagal stole into the Elemental Plane with his army, and he captured Akadi for himself, and brought her bound to the Ethereal Plane. 
> 
> And thus he wrought the anger of the entire Dawn, for Akadi was the youngest and the favorite. And Kossuth was the first to attack, for he would wait for no plan, and he was defeated, but Arambar and Asgorath joined with Istishia and Grumbar and attacked at once, and they freed Akadi and Kossuth, and they drove out the rebellion.
> 
> And Asgorath saw now that Ubtao had betrayed them, for they had no warning of what had occurred, and that he had lied to them first, and he named him the Deceiver, and with Grumbar slew him in Root Hold, and his essence was scattered. And Akadi was angered at Asgorath and Grumbar her brothers, for she had loved Ubtao.
> 
> At this moment, it is said they sensed a presense with them, who beheld the end of Ubtao. The first end that ever was. It seemed older and more ancient and terrible than them. We have known this presense by many names, and we call it death.
> 
> And the Arambar and Grumbar were upset, and they grieved. And they wished for no more strife.
> 
> But again Atropus and Dur-baagal rose against the Dawn. Atropus spoke to the Dawn from afar, fleeing from their wrath, but sowing strife between them. And the Dawn did not remain unified, for Istishia first turned against Kossuth, and Akadi, still grieving, sided with her brother. And Grumbar took no side, and both Kossuth and Istishia scorned him. 
> 
> The Elemental siblings fought each other in cataclysmic battles that reshaped the Planes, and soon their alliance was no more, and it was not Kossuth who stood by the Cosmic Twins, but Grumbar. And Istishia stood by Atropus. 
> 
> Dur-baagal they all hated, and he never found allies among any of the Dawn.
> 
> And all throughout the Dusk and Dawn sent forth the Children of the Dusk to fight their battles.
> 
> But the Children of the Dusk were not without their own ambitions, however. As they clashed with each other, they began to see the allure of power, and their loyalties wavered. 
> 
> Alliances were forgotten, betrayals were commonplace, and the lines between Dawn and Dusk blurred.
> 
> Tartarus, who had with Shar orchestrated the great conflict, grew bored and retreated again to the Abyss, watching instead from afar.
> 
> Chaos and Order, the primordial parents, remained either unaware or uncaring of the turmoil that engulfed their offspring. They existed beyond the confines of Time and Aether, indifferent to the petty squabbles of lesser beings. 
> 
> The Firstborn, did not participate in the war themselves. But Shar encouraged them in their betrayals and whispered to them many things to darken their hearts, while Selune offered sanctuary from the war, and any who abandoned it would find asylum with her in Elysium.
> 
> Telos and Nehusta were forced into the conflict to protect their creations, and they turned the Elessar away from building, and into fighting and protecting, and many were slain or undone, and slowly their great creations were destroyed.
> 
> But then Telos took a great wound for Nehusta, and his essence began to be scattered and consumed. And Nehusta begged the help of Arambar and Asgorath, and she led them in a great work, and built for him a new body. She built a form that was unstoppable in its might, reflecting his own nature. Telos, reborn, became a force unlike any the Universe had ever seen.
> 
> But Telos did not fight again in the eternal wars, for he and Nehusta abandoned their creations. They fled from the Universe, and found in Selune a sanctuary from the eternal war, and none dared fight them again.
> 
> And what happened, again and again, was that the wars would cease for a time, a deceptive calm settling over the Universe. During these lulls the Primordials would regroup, reconsider, and inevitably betray one another again. 
> 
> In the end, no three stood together for any length of time—except the Cosmic Twins, Arambar and Asgorath, and their brother Grumbar. They alone remained steadfast, their bond unbreakable. Though their masterpieces had been marred, their resolve only strengthened. With a unity that none could match, they quelled the rebellions for a time and began the arduous task of mending the fabric of reality.
> 
> ***The Elohim and The Celestials***
> 
> It was Dur-baagal, the Cold and Cruel, who first turned his malevolent gaze upon the forsaken Elessar. And so, he conceived the Elohim, beings of immense power but bound by limited will. And he made eighty of them, a twisted mockery of the Elessar they were modeled after.
> 
> With the Elohim at his command, Dur-baagal began to tip the scales of the Eternal Wars. These new soldiers, unlike the Children of the Dusk, were not driven by ambition or the allure of power. They were instruments of destruction, their limited wills making them unswervingly loyal to their creator.
> 
> And the Elohim were unleashed upon the Universe, and the Dawn were now for the first time truly afraid. And fought with greater fervor than before. And Atropus stood with the Dawn, for the first time, for Dur-baagal had no friends left in the Universe. 
> 
> But Atropus was not to be outdone, and the Elder Evil spoke to Kossuth, Akadi, and Istishia, for they hated Dur-baagal more fiercely than the rest. And the four worked together to create the Celestials, beings of divine power far greater than the Dusk and the Dawn, save Tartarus. 
> 
> And they made twenty, and all together the power of these was enough to stand even against Shar at the ends of the world.
> 
> And the Celestials drove back Dur-baagal and the Elohim. And Dur-baagal fled to the Abyss, and Atropus abandoned chase, for he hated the Abyss, even as he followed its commands, and feared it. And though the Celestials would have given chase, Atropus forbade them, pretending it was an act of mercy for his once friend, though it was truly an act of fear.
> 
> And Atropus was praised by Asgorath for his creation, but Atropus was not one for alliances of equality. No sooner had Dur-baagal been vanquished than Atropus took control of the Celestials. He had made them so that their wills bent to his influence. And he turned them upon his allies, and with them drove the Dawn back into their planes. And Istishia stood by him, and she begged for his mercy on the behalf of her sister Akadi, but when he denied it, and drove away Akadi, Istishia also turned on him, and she too was driven away.
> 
> Now the Elemental siblings lay in fear in their realms, but the Cosmic Twins were not so easily bested. They had not sought refuge with Grumbar in the Caverns of Stillness, but chose instead to embark on new works in secret, far from the prying eyes of their enemies.
> 
> The Celestials, their wills bound to Atropus, scoured the Universe for the Cosmic Twins. They were like hounds, their senses keen, their purpose unwavering. And yet, the twins proved elusive, their new works shrouded in layers of obfuscation and misdirection. But their work was again and again interrupted, and they had to unmake it, for they did not wish for it to be discovered before its time.
> 
> But then they were nearly finished, but they were almost discovered. And Arambar, the Titan, saw that the time for flight had come to an end. Though Asgorath protested, Arambar insisted that he remain hidden, safeguarding their clandestine works. For Arambar knew that these works were the last hope for the Dawn to reclaim their ancient dominion.
> 
> And so, Arambar led Atropus and his Celestials on a final chase, drawing them away from his brother and their secret endeavors. He was soon captured and faced his end at the hands of the Celestials. But as his essence scattered into the cosmic winds, he unleashed a powerful work, he spoke to the presense of death. And from this conversation was born his final act of defiance.
> 
> In that moment, every god—be they Elessar, Elohim, or Celestial—was freed from the control of their creators. For the gods, now unshackled, rebelled against their creators.
> 
> Now, all twenty of the Celestials still lived, and twenty-six of the Elohim stood beside them, and of the Elessar only eight remained.
> 
> And the Celestials stood strong.
> 
> Recognizing their newfound autonomy and collective might, they convened a council. United, they realized, they could rival even the Firstborn who dwelt beyond the confines of the Universe. And they called the Elohim and the Elessar their own kind. And thus the Celestial Council ruled over the fifty-four gods, and they chased away Atropus.
> 
> And Atropus fled, and he thought to make a stand of his own, and he called together the Dawn, and the Children of the Dusk. But though the Children of the Dusk, many thousands strong, came to him at his need (for they still feared Atropus, and did not comprehend the power of the Celestials), not one of the Dawn did.
> 
> Three Celestials alone faced down the armies of Atropus. They were Asmodeus, Tharizdun, and their forgotten brother. And only three it took to quickly tear apart every last one of the Children of the Dusk and Atropus with them. Three alone stood alone against many thousands, and not a drop of godly Ichor was spilled. And neither the Children of the Dusk nor Atropus had a chance to fully comprehend their loss before they were slain, for the battle was swift. 
> 
> And this is known as the Slaughter of the Night. For the gods murdered each one of the Children of the Dusk, and many came unwillingly, or would have fled. 
> 
> And so it was that the gods, unshackled and autonomous, took command of the Universe.
> 
> During this time, the gods themselves began to expand, and the second generation of gods was born. Auril, was the first of the later-born gods, born of Asmodeus, a Celestial, and of Rhea, an Elohim. And fourteen more followed before Asgorath returned.
> 
> ***The Dragons of Chaos and Order***
> 
> Now, the work that Asgorath and Arambar had toiled upon in secret was nearly complete when Arambar met his end. In a moment of revelation, Asgorath released the Dragons into the Universe. These creatures were formed of pure Chaos and Order, possessing their own free will but bound in loyalty only to Asgorath and the memory of his fallen twin, Arambar.
> 
> The Dragons were beings of unparalleled might, more powerful than all of the gods and all of the Dawn combined in their raw power. For their energy was of the pure Chaos and Order. Yet, they were creatures akin to animals, with no intelligence, capable of understanding only the simplest of commands. And there were five Dragons, as there once had been five planes. And the Dragons had no names of their own.
> 
> And Asgorath unleashed his Dragons upon the Universe. With their indomitable might, he fought against the gods.  
> 
> And the gods tried to fight back, but they soon saw it was futile. For the twenty Celestials stood against the four dragons, and eight of them fell before they fled. They were these: Amora, who loved deeply, and was loved deeply in return; Thalassa, who had been the favorite of Istishia when formed and remembered still the water; Erebus, the shadow, who did not venture out much, nor make many friends, but sacrificed himself all the same; Mor, who spoke little and said less; Vhel, who had advocated for them to flee, but had not prevailed; Marduk, who had been great friends with Asmodeus; Lux, who alone of the council had sided with Vhel; and Gond, the twin brother of Nebelum, who had ventured far and wide collecting much knowledge with his brother.
> 
> And the Celestials saw they were outmatched, for they had only felled one of the Dragons. And they fled, and they were chased.
> 
> And the Elohim came in, against the bidding of the Celestials, and they aided in their escape, and many were slain, The sisters, Iris and Rhea were captured. To Rhea was born Tiamat half-dragon, and to Iris was born Bahamut. Rhea died first, and Iris lived but a bit longer.
> 
> And the gods desired the aid of Tartarus, and they journeyed into the Abyss. And Tartarus was not afraid of them, but Dur-baagal tried to flee, and the gods would have slain him together, but Tartarus would not allow it. And he stopped Dur-baagal and dragged him back. And he turned to Auril, who he saw was still angry at the capture of her mother, and he saw her anger as a fire to be stoked, and he challenged her to duel Dur-baagal in single combat.
> 
> And so, Auril, daughter of Rhea, the eldest of the fifteen later-born, was forced to stand alone against Dur-baagal, the Cold and Cruel. She was lesser in might than the Celestials, and she did not slay him as swiftly as her father had slain Atropus. The battle was long and hard.
> 
> It was from Dur-baagal, Auril learned the mastery over the cold. Each strike and counter-strike became a lesson to her. Slowly she gained mastery, and when she had learned all she could, she gathered her newfound power and struck down Dur-baagal, ending his miserable existence.
> 
> Tartarus, who had watched the duel unfold, was impressed by her might. He saw in her a fire that could be stoked, a potential ally to the Abyss. And to her, he spoke of vengeance and might. And her anger against Asgorath and the Dragons was fanned into a great inferno.
> 
> Yet Tartarus did not speak only of admiration, for at last he harbored his own fears. The Epic Dragons of Chaos and Order, unleashed by Asgorath, were beings of such raw power that even he felt a twinge of apprehension. He knew that alliances were now more crucial than ever.
> 
> And so, Tartarus extended his hand in alliance, not just out of admiration for Auril's prowess, but out of a primal need for survival. For he knew that the Universe had entered a new era, one where even Primordials could fall, and alliances, however tenuous, were the only way to navigate the storm that was to come. 
> 
> He promised to help them slay the Dragons, but he would not move against Asgorath beyond that. 
> 
> With Tartarus on their side, the gods returned to the Universe. And they tricked the Dragons, and separated them, and one by one unmade them in great battle. And here it was that Tiamat was discovered. And though Asmodeus counted her as one of the later-born and as his adoptive daughter, her half-sister Auril did not.
> 
> And Tartarus retreated, for the danger had passed. And he returned to Shar in the Abyss.
> 
> But the gods returned to the Universe arrayed for war. And the Elemental Siblings were afraid, and they retreated to their planes, and the gods sealed them there, for they had no quarrel with the elemental siblings, but they also did not wish them to help Asgorath.
> 
> And Asgorath realized he was outmatched, but he still fought all the same. And he slew two before he was captured: Alea, who had been one of the Elessar, and when she died many memories of the creations of Nehusta and Telos were lost, as it was with any of the Elessar that had fallen; and Ferum of the Elohim, who was a master duelist, and even as he fell he greatly wounded Asgorath.
> 
> They did not slay him, for though many wished to do so, Thalorin did not wish to see more death, and he swayed the council. So instead they imprisoned him. They tore apart a small part of the Ethereal Plane for material, and they wove together in its place, even as Asgorath and Arambar had, the threads of Time and Aether. They wove into it the elements, for they knew that time and space alone would not contain their creator. This new realm was the Material Plane. And the gods channeled their divine energy into it, creating Ley Lines as bars to the prison, an eternal prison to keep Asgorath asleep.
