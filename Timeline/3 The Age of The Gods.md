The gods tore the fifth plane, that the home of Azgorath and Arambar, and created out of it a sixth true plane, a prison to hold the epic dragons and Azgorath trapped in it's bindings. They did this with the help of the four elemental primordials. A plane filled with matter. A plane most closely tied to time and space. In it, galaxies and stars and things began to form.

## The Ranks of the Gods

In the aftermath of the Eternal Wars, the gods found themselves in a new era. The [[Celestial Council]], now reduced to twelve, stood as the highest echelon of divine authority. And they formed a larger council, known as the [[Greater Council]], and it was forged of the Celestials, the Elessar, the Elohim, and those of the Later-Born who came before the end of the Eternal Wars. These were the gods who had been born before the cataclysmic conflicts that had reshaped the [[Eärendor|Universe]], and they were known as the greater gods. Their wisdom was sought, their judgments revered, and their power unmatched.

Beneath them, in a tier of their own, were the gods of the [[Senate]]. These were the deities who had come into existence after the Eternal Wars. Though not as potent as the Celestials, they were numerous and held considerable sway over various aspects of the Universe. Their voices filled the senate chambers with debates and discussions, shaping the cosmic laws that governed all existence.

The third generation of gods, and all those who came after, were known as the lesser gods. They were the caretakers of specific realms, guardians of particular elements, and patrons of various mortal endeavors. Their influence was more localized, but in their domains, they were absolute.

This triad of divine hierarchy—the Celestial Council, The Greater Council, The Senate of greater gods, and the lesser gods—formed the backbone of the new divine order.
## The Construction of Arvandor

Led by [[Hekate]], the Mistress of Magic, and [[Nebelum]], the Keeper of Secrets, the gods convened to bring their vision to life. Hekate, with her unparalleled mastery over the arcane, was the architect, weaving the very fabric of this new realm. Nebelum, whose wisdom was as vast as the secrets he kept, served as the planner, laying out the intricate details that would make [[Arvandor]] not just a sanctuary, but a fortress of divine power.

The Celestial Council lent their immense energies to the endeavor, each contributing a facet of their essence to imbue Arvandor with a myriad of divine attributes. The greater gods of the senate, too, offered their powers, infusing the realm with their specialized dominions, be it love, war, wisdom, or the elements. The lesser gods, though not as potent, provided the finishing touches, crafting the nooks and crannies, the hidden groves and secret chambers that gave Arvandor its complexity.

The gods worked in harmony, their powers converging in a dazzling display of divine magic. Streams of energy, each a different hue, spiraled into a focal point, weaving together to form the ethereal tapestry that would become Arvandor. As the energies mingled, the realm began to take shape within the Ethereal Plane, its boundaries expanding, its essence solidifying.

As the energies coalesced, the ethereal fabric of the plane began to ripple and fold, giving form to Arvandor. Mountains rose, rivers flowed, and celestial bodies took their places in the sky. Forests sprang up, filled with flora of unimaginable beauty, and oceans teemed with mythical creatures. The air itself was imbued with a sense of peace and power, a perfect balance that only divine hands could achieve.

Each god then took to crafting their own domain within Arvandor. These domains were as varied as the gods themselves, reflecting their unique essences and powers. Temples, palaces, and fortresses materialized, each a masterpiece of divine architecture. Gardens of eternal spring neighbored realms of endless night, and domains of pure elemental force lay adjacent to sanctuaries of transcendent wisdom.

Time within Arvandor was a fluid concept, allowing the gods to step away from the relentless march of cosmic events. Here, they could rest, convene in grand councils, and plot the unfolding tapestry of the Universe. The realm was not just a sanctuary; it was a stronghold, fortified with divine magic to protect against any who would dare intrude upon the gods' affairs.

Finally, the construction was complete. The gods stepped back to admire their collective work, a realm of such beauty and power that it defied mortal comprehension. Arvandor was now the divine home.

Thus, Arvandor stood as a monument to divine unity and power, a realm crafted by the hands of gods, for the gods.

## Era of Peace

With Arvandor's completion, a new chapter in the cosmic narrative began—an Era of Peace. The gods, now with a sanctuary to call home, found themselves less embroiled in the conflicts and intrigues that had once consumed their divine energies. The Celestial Council convened regularly, not in times of crisis, but in times of contemplation and planning.

The greater gods of the senate, too, found solace in this newfound stability. They took to their roles as guardians and mentors to the lesser gods, guiding them in the arts of divine governance and cosmic balance. The lesser gods, in turn, flourished under this tutelage, their powers growing as they took on responsibilities within their own domains and in the Universe at large.

The peace within Arvandor radiated outward. The Elemental Siblings, sealed in their realms, sensed the tranquility and ceased their own squabbles, at least for a time. Even the Abyss, that cauldron of eternal strife, seemed to simmer down, its denizens less eager to provoke divine wrath.

Yet, this peace was not one of inaction or complacency. It was a proactive peace, one of planning, growth, and fortification. The gods knew that the Universe was an ever-changing tapestry, and they used this time to weave stronger threads, to mend the frayed edges, and to prepare for whatever challenges lay ahead.

During this era, alliances were forged, not out of necessity to combat a common foe, but out of mutual respect and shared goals. Pacts were made, divine energies were channeled into new creations, and the gods explored the far reaches of the Universe, ever expanding their understanding of the cosmic order.

The Era of Peace, as it came to be known, was a golden age for the gods and their creations. It was a time when the divine could focus on the sublime, on the beautiful, and on the just. And so, for a time, Arvandor and its divine inhabitants knew peace, a peace as profound as the realm itself, a testament to what could be achieved when gods stand united.

## The Reconciliation with the Primordials

During the Era of Peace, the gods sought to mend the rifts that had long separated them from the Primordials. Recognizing the value of cosmic balance and the intricate interplay between divine and primordial forces, overtures were made to reestablish diplomatic ties.

[[Akadi]], the Primordial of Air, found a particular affinity with the gods of Arvandor. Her ethereal nature and love for freedom resonated with the gods, and she became a frequent guest in their celestial realm. Her presence was often accompanied by gentle breezes that wafted through the divine domains.

[[Tartarus]], too, was extended an invitation. His visits to Arvandor were rare but impactful, for he and [[Shar]] planned them carefully. And they always left intense debates and discussions that would have scattered the Primordials, but the gods, it seemed, were wiser, or more unified, and they did not turn against each other, but they also did not realize Tartarus's machinations.

[[Grumbar]], [[Kossuth]], and [[Istishia]], however, were less inclined to frequent Arvandor. Their elemental natures made them more comfortable in their own realms, and while diplomatic channels were open, their visits remained infrequent.

As for [[Telos]] and [[Nehusta]], they found their sanctuary in [[Elysium]] with [[Selune]]. Content in their peaceful retreat, they seldom ventured into Arvandor, though the lines of communication were theoretically open, the gods did not speak with the Primordials in Elysium.

This period of reconciliation did much to heal old wounds and lay the foundation for a more harmonious cosmic order.
