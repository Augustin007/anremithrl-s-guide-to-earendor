~10,000-5,000 BS: The Age of Awakening
The first life, trees and animals come to be. Elves and Ents are the first sentient beings to be created. Whether the Unknown Name (The God of Death) or the Hidden Name (The being of unknown origin, which often is called the god of Death/Marriage, but isn't properly a god. Marethyu in early language means death and marriage, and that is what he is often called) created them, scholars differ.  The Astral Plane is created for the souls of the dead. 
Humans are the secondborn. As a few other gods pick it up, others are created. These are the prominent species. Dwarves, halflings, and goliaths. 
Akida creates the Aarakocra and the Aven. The other primordials in their own planes create some of their own life. plasmoids. From her also come the Djinn.
gnomes, fae, changelings created by Azmodeus
Making life becomes more popular, several gods join in, mixing beasts just for fun. This creates centaurs, naga, owlfolk, and some of the others.

Gods constantly interfere, and meddle with life. Making it hard for them to progress. They create and wipe out several hundreds of species.
A group of humans are converted into the first Kor.
Some of the species are similar enough to reproduce. Creating half-breeds.
The gods create other beings, Angels and Maiar and the like, to be their voices and servants.
Beyond this, the gods mate with the humans, and from there come the first Tieflings and Aasimar.
goblins, orcs, trolls, hobgoblin, verdan are created by gods who want to be entertained by raids and wars. First Orcus(Goblins and trolls), and then perfected by Ares (Hobgoblins, orcs, and verdan).
Some species go deep underground to avoid the notice of the gods. Some gods still notice them all the same. This begins the formation of the underdark.

This was a time of unparalleled creativity for the gods. Each took turns adding their unique essence to these new realms, crafting flora and fauna, celestial bodies, and even natural laws that governed the physics of each sub-plane. The gods reveled in their acts of creation, each new life form, each mountain or star, serving to strengthen the Ley Lines and, by extension, the prison that held Asgorath.

> In a move that would forever alter the cosmic landscape, a god—the forgotten sibling to Asmodeus and Tharizdun—undertook an audacious act. He created humans, beings endowed with free will yet constrained by mortality. But he did not stop there; he also crafted the Fey Elves, ethereal entities of sublime beauty, and the Shadar-Kai, enigmatic beings born of shadow and enigma.
> 
> And for these mortal beings he created a sub-plane also in the Ethereal Plane, The Astral Plane, where after their death the mortal creatures could continue to watch events unfold in the Material Plane, though they could no longer influence it.
> 
> And many mimicked him. Nebelum and Geb created the Dwarves, they were sturdy and steadfast, mirroring their creators' love for craftsmanship and order. And they also created the Gnomes, imbued with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a knack for arcane arts. 
> 
> Orcus created first the Goblins, and then, with Ares's help, perfected them. Orcus and Ares created the Orcs They embodied strength and a relentless drive for conquest.
> 
> Akadi, in her own realm, the Plane of Air, with the aid of Hekate, formed the Djinn. And then she also made other beings, the Aarakokra and the Kenku and the creatures of Air.
> 
> Halflings, centuars, fauns, faeries, and countless other species emerged, each a reflection of their divine creator's essence and will.
> 
> But they were mortal, and shortly after they were created, the first mortals were touched by death.
