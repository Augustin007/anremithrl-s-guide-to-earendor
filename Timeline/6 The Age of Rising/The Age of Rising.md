The Age of Rising (~3000-1,200 BS):
Later tribes and kingdoms begin to form. Larger kingdoms like the Ardwedili and Narheth. 
Fendrel used mathematics to predict an eclipse, chart planets more accurately, monitor the movement of ley lines, and other such events. He worked with Liriel the stargazer for some time.
Sunktopeth is formed in the south. 
Brundar Deepmine - Dwarven geologist who first theorized about the layering of rock strata and mineral veins.
Finn suggested art as an approach to harnessing internal magical powers.
Tiberon was an apothecary and alchemist who greatly advanced chemical and alchemical understandings.
What is sometimes called the ancestor to the Solenthiri nation is formed.
Gwendolyn the Herbalist. Advanced the study of botany with her comprehensive classifications of flora and their medicinal properties.
Gorim applied mathematical concepts to forging and tools.
Karik of Gondal expanded algebra and the idea of a number. Karik was the first person to talk about negative numbers, and use them in his mathematics.
Halbaron was a dwarven engineer who formulated early geometric principles.
Jorin Tormund was instrumental in developing early number theory. He was the father of Nemi Tormund, who was a warlock of Azmodeus and the grandmother of Tahlia Tormund.
Magnar Rilion, an elf of the Dravaran, becomes the first mortal to become a dragon after seeking the blessing of Arvandor.
He slays the tyrant Tar-Nakthos and earns the title Tar-Rilion.
Meril, the alchemist, advanced alchemy, biology, and chemistry far further, creating the first healing potions. His catalogues were extensive. He wrote a lot about chemistry.
Elthon of Sarnor was the first to outline very specific rules for logic, and was the first to tie logic and mathematics together, demanding proof of mathematical statements. He tried to tie together all of mathematics at the time, but died of illness before he could.
Erindor developed basic principles of trigonometry for cartography.
Selina of Aloria wrote the book titled simply "Proofs", which summarised all known geometry and algebra at the time into a series of proofs. She discounted trigonometry as being 'unprovable'.
Dorin Lightfoot was a Hobbit mathematician who created basic mathematics on probability and applied it to games of chance to make himself a fortune, his secrets were spilled after his assasination.
Arioch the Alchemist. Made early strides in alchemy, attempting to classify elements and compounds, and their effects on the weave.
Early spells were beginning to be written down in this time. Noteably, "On Magic" by the Elessar Elian. Physics ideas of aether, time, and planes begin to form in this time as well. Models for how it all interacts. Ideas of magical energy begin to occur. Many scientific ideas of this time are compiled by Tarnis in his writing titled "True Planes and Stuff"
Rondar was a mathematical prodigy who spent his life developing number theory much further, developing concepts of sets, classes, and categories. He lived through the Sundered War and was Tal'berius's , Garrett, and Artorius's teacher.
Artorius and Tal were brothers and both incredibly intelligent, though Artorius was always kinder than Tal'berius. They were both students of Rondar, and pushed his ideas even further. Artorius did not have Tal'berius's raw magical talent, but they both liked making things explode and were fascinated by magical items and artifice, to Rondar's (who had no magic, and did not consider it much) disaproval. (Artorius would die fighting Vecna during the Sundered War)
Garrett was an early inventor of magical gadgets, blending rudimentary engineering with enchantments. He studied first with Rondar, but could not keep up, and later apprenticed himself to the brothers Tal'berius and Artorius.
Twelve years before the sundering war, Tal'berius and Artorius's Codex Arcanum strongly argued that knowledge of logic was foundational for studying the Arcane. They included an introduction to logic in the text, as well as one-hundred and twenty pages introducing alchemy and artifice, four-hundred and forty-five mathematical proofs, eighteen pages on categorisation of different magics, sources of magics, types of magic, and natures of it, arguing (correctly) psionic talents were not of the same nature as magic, and a compilation of "Three hundred spells of usefulness for sorcerers learning to reign in their powers", which were descriptions of how each spell worked, how it felt to cast it, and recommendations on imprinting and moving the spell around, including early rune theory, and mathematics related to the spell. They created early calculation and mathematics spells with divination and introduced the concept of a limit. They also added a section on his new idea, "Constructs", and wrote another hundred pages outlining early algorithmic theory and how you could create spells that could follow logically well-defined instructions to automate more vast processes.
Magnar’s sons, Tal’berius and Artorius, become legendary scholars and magicians, compiling the *Codex Arcanum*.

Skirmishes arise between Thalassos and Eldorath over control of Echoriath and its ancient magics.
The first signs of ancient meddling in mortal affairs reappear as Shar whispers to ambitious mortals.
Araushnee advanced the study of necromancy by exploring the magical properties of life force and death essence. 
Vecna creates the great plague, which spreads across the land. In the Taur-en-Faroth, this causes the death of Araushnee's son.

Long before the Sundering, when mortals first began to walk the earth, and history was first being writ. Even as the Taur en Faroth was being founded a continent away, the realm of Hathros was first being settled and inhabited. 

There was much unrest between those who dwelt in Hathros, and there were many cities ruled by many peoples, and between them there were many wars. 

And in this region there dwelt a dwarf named Calbarum, and he was a farmer, and a man of strength. He was descended from Andaius, who had been a prince of Daran, which had sunk beneath the waves, and his grandfather was Andaius's son. 

Now Calbarum was a noble man, and he stood in defense of his city many times. But he was wearied by the constant war. His people first fled their city, raising a new city, hidden in the deep great mountains, this city was called Mycenae.

Calbarum wished for peace between the cities, and he would often leave his hidden nation and advocate for it, but he would not live to see this peace.

It was said that Thadred had feared Calbarum while he was alive, for shortly after his death it was that Thadred raised an army, and began conquering the region.

Anamos was a mortal of Mycenae who spoke with gods, and he was a friend of Varian, the Celestial, who came to the mortal plane often from Arvandor. Together, the two inspired much hope, and they led forces against Thadred, and when all was said and done, there was a vast region which pledged themselves to Anamos and Varian, and the people called themselves the Anami.

Now Anamos was mortal, but from then on Varian ruled the country of Thalassos, and he chose regents to rule whenever he left.

Then it was that the Elessar Caellus, he who brought the sun and moon into the sky, descended from Arvandor, and he took abode in the region, and he dwelt in the country of Thalassos, in the city of Thara, and his followers flocked there, and brought it much prosperity.

Further in the south the country of Eldorath was founded by those who were displeased with Varian's rule. They pledged themselves to Nebelum and accumulated knowledge. They housed a great library, known in the land.

And from the tips of the iron hills were the Dravaran, who lived around a great lake and in the forests, these were the remnant of those who were conquered by Thadred.

Now, in the valley known as Echoriath, right at the border of the Dravaran and the Thalassos, there were burgeons of ancient magic, remnants from Azgorath's capture, and it fell to the Ring of Varian, a circle of his highest followers, to re-cast there the bindings that held Azgorath in place.

The country of Thalassos was filled with dams and roads and bridges. It had armies and navies, and it was the largest of the countries of old.

Now in this region lived Magnar Rilion. He was an elf of the Dravaran. And he was greatly generous, despite living in the poverty of Dravaran, and he lived near Echoriath, and the magic of it clung to him. And he became a sorcerer of great power. He could not reign in his magic, and it would explode out of him. He sought the help of the gods, and the council of Arvandor gave him a blessing, and he became the first mortal dragon, and he had now control over his powers. 

And when Tar-Nakthos came into power, and enacted great cruelties, he killed the tyrant and became known as Tar-Rilion, and was known as a good king.

His descendents were his sons Tal'berius and Artorius and his daughter Nanor and the draconic magic had faded little between generations, though there form only had the slightest draconic aspect. 

Now Tal'berius and Artorius were the elder, and they were devoted to learning, and they were strong in magic and learning. and among other things, they compiled the Codex Arcanum. They studied under the greatest minds of the age.

Nanor was born only a year before the sundering.
