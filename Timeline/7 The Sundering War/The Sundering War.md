## The Ascension of Araushnee

And so it was that in the early days of the mortal world, the Elven Queen Araushnee's son was one of the first to be taken by death.

Araushnee at first was struck by grief, but eventually this grief turned to insanity and to anger.

Araushnee, once a beacon of grace and wisdom, found herself consumed by an unquenchable fury. Her eyes, once filled with the light of compassion, now glowed with a malevolent fire. The Elven Queen could not reconcile with the cosmic injustice that had befallen her, and she sought to challenge the very gods who had ordained the mortal coil.

Now in those days, magic was not well known by mortals, for the gift was newly given from Hekate. But Araushnee's people, the Elves, followed her in secret, studying great magics, for many of them too had been touched by death. United in their sorrow and driven by their queen's indomitable will, they delved into arcane texts and whispered incantations under the cover of night.

After years of clandestine study and preparation, Araushnee and her most trusted mages gathered at an intersection of Ley Lines, shrouded by the ancient trees of their homeland. There, they began to chant, their voices rising and falling in a haunting melody that echoed through the forest. The air grew thick with magical energy, each word of their spell pulling at the very fabric of reality. And they manipulated the Ley Lines, siphoning small bits of the divine magic to fuel their spell.

As they reached the crescendo of their incantation, a rift in the veil between worlds appeared. It was a portal to Arvandor, the realm of the gods, shimmering with celestial light. Araushnee stepped through, her figure bathed in the ethereal glow, her eyes set with a steely resolve.

"I demand but one thing," she began. And then she spoke the forgotten name of the god of death. And her words echoed through the divine halls. "Let not the souls of the dead be locked away in isolation. Anchor them loosely, so they may not be lost to us forever."

Her plea was heartfelt, her words imbued with the raw emotion of her loss. 

She spoke of her son, of the unbearable void his death had left in her life. Many gods who listened were moved by her words, their own hearts stirring with empathy.

But the god of death remained unmoved. He looked upon Araushnee, not with disdain, but with the solemnity that befits his role in the cosmic order.

"You are not sundered from him eternally," he said, his voice as calm as the still air in a crypt. "When your time comes, you shall meet him. Until then, the laws that govern life and death shall remain."

But she was not consoled. "Very well," she said, her voice tinged with a venomous calm. "If the laws that govern life and death shall remain, then let those laws be governed by one who understands their weight."

And she gave a signal to her mages, who had entered behind her. They had prepared a spell, and Araushnee whispered a Word of Power. And the god of death did not see what would happen until a moment to late.

And it seemed to the each of the Celestial Council that the light of their fellows had dimmed. Araushnee had undone the magic of Arvandor, for she had discovered the secret words with which it had been made.

And they saw now, the celestial god of death was muted, for he did not seem as he once was. And they watched as his divine power left him, and entered Araushnee. 

Araushnee unsheathed a dagger, its blade forged from the tears of her sorrow, and with a swift, decisive motion, she drove it into the heart of the god of death. His form disintegrated, scattering into motes of fading light, his existence erased so completely that even his name was wiped from the annals of memory.

"Let it be known," she declared, her voice echoing through the now-silent halls of Arvandor, "that the souls of the dead shall not be lost to us."

And the gods trembled, for Araushnee was no longer just an elven queen; she was now a god, her name forever etched into the annals of divine history. But she was a god who bore a terrible secret, the only one who remembered the name of the god she had slain, a name that now resided solely in the depths of her tormented soul.

And Araushnee stood in the celestial halls of Arvandor, her newfound power coursing through her veins. She attempted to fulfill her promise—to anchor the souls of the dead so they may not be lost to their loved ones. She reached into the fabric of the cosmos, her divine essence seeking the Astral Plane, where the souls of the departed resided.

But as she touched the delicate weave of the Astral Plane, she realized the intricate balance that held the realms together. Her newfound power was too raw, too uncontrolled. And in her attempt to open forth the Astral Plane, she shattered it instead.

The realms trembled, and the souls of those who had died before were destroyed, their essence scattering into the cosmic winds. The Astral Plane, once a sanctuary for the departed, was now a void, a realm of emptiness and lost souls.

And so it was that Araushnee became the Raven Queen, a name that would forever echo with sorrow and regret. The gods, witnessing her reckless act, shunned her. Yet, they would not slay her, for some still pitied her.

They exiled her from Arvandor, casting her into the Shadowfell, a realm of darkness and introspection. There, they muted her powers over death, leaving her as but a shadow of a power.

In her exile, the Raven Queen locked herself away in a Palace of Memories, a demiplane woven from the very fabric of the Shadowfell. It was a little asylum she crafted, a sanctuary amidst the lawlessness around her. And in this palace, she became the goddess of memory.

For she hoarded all the memories and all the stories she could find, preserving them in her palace as a tapestry. And she locked herself away with the memories she had of her son, and she drove herself into insanity.

## The Vengeance of Asmodeus and Tharizdun

Now, the Raven Queen's actions caused many to be angry. Among those most incensed were Asmodeus and Tharizdun, brothers to the now-forgotten god of death. Their fury was a tempest, a maelstrom of divine wrath that could not be quelled by mere words or celestial edicts.

Asmodeus seethed, and he saw that she remained unpunished in her palace of memory, and his patience wore thin. And he gathered a great number of the gods who would heed his call, and he spoke to them in the Halls of Justice. "She shall not go unpunished," he declared, his voice a low growl, "for her insolence, she shall know suffering beyond measure."

And the gods ventured to the quasi-plane that formed from the border of the Material Plane and the Abyss, and they formed of it the Nine Hells. And Orcus and Hekate forged great chains, and imbued each link with curses and spells of binding, and others set to work on many things, and formed of the nine hells an inescapable prison.

Armed and ready, they descended upon the Raven Queen's Palace of Memories in the Shadowfell. Asmodeus shattered the protective wards Araushnee had placed around her sanctuary. They stormed the palace.

Finding her amidst the labyrinthine corridors of her own sorrow, they seized the Raven Queen. The chains of the Nine Hells wrapped around her, each link biting into her divine essence, sapping her of her newfound powers. Her screams were a cacophony that shook the very foundations of the Shadowfell, but they fell on deaf ears.

And they dragged her into the Nine Hells. They had formed of it a prison strong enough to hold gods, its walls etched with runes of containment and torment. There, they subjected her to tortures unimaginable, and each torment seemed afresh and new, designed to break her power, her body, and her spirit.

Back in the celestial realms, murmurs of discontent rippled through the divine community. Some gods were uneasy, their consciences pricked by the Raven Queen's cruel fate. Yet none acted, for the Raven Queen was an outsider, a deity who had ascended through audacity rather than divine mandate. And so, they turned their eyes away, their silence an unspoken assent to her suffering.

But the gods were not appeased by the chaining of the Raven Queen. And as the Raven Queen languished in her infernal prison, a faction began to form among the gods. Led by Tharizdun their hearts were filled with disdain for the mortals whose existence they blamed for the loss of their celestial kin. "It is the mortals who are the root of this calamity," Tharizdun proclaimed, his voice a discordant melody that unsettled even the most steadfast of gods. "Their very existence has led to the death of one of our own. They must be purged."

They descended upon the Material Plane, their wrath manifesting as cataclysms that shattered kingdoms and extinguished lives. Earthquakes, plagues, and storms of fire rained down upon the mortal realms, reducing once-thriving civilizations to smoldering ruins.

Nor did they spare the Gentle Zephyr|Plane of Air, where Akadi's creations soared. With malevolent glee, they unleashed tempests that tore through the skies, scattering the creatures that lived there, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.

Asmodeus did not partake in this onslaught. He deemed the mortals to insignificant to warrant any true combat. He saw them as ants unworthy of the boot that came to crush them. 

He wished to unmake them, and he called for a council of the gods, and spoke to them of many things, and his silver tongue spoke only truths, but those truths most damning to the mortals, and as he spoke many were fooled and thought he spoke of reason and not of anger, "Shall we not consider," he proposed, "the unmaking of mortals? To undo this flawed creation and begin anew, with caution and foresight?"

And many gods, still reeling from the audacity of the Raven Queen and the ferocity schism, were inclined to agree with Asmodeus. "Perhaps it is time to wipe the slate clean," they murmured among themselves.

Akadi, still mourning the devastation wrought upon her realm, said nothing, for she could not bring herself to say words.

And it was Thalorin who spoke first against them, for he was ever caring, and because of his care his mind was clear, and he saw the anger in Asmodeus. And he spoke first to all the gods, "the mortals are our creations, but they have come into their own. We ought not to unmake them and rob them of what little happiness they have left, for I have seen they find it even in dark times like these, when Tharizdun leads unsanctioned attacks against the smallest of mortals. They possess the capacity for great good, for love. It would be a great evil to unmake them." 

And the hearts of some were moved, and Thalorin spoke on.

"Do you not believe in law, Asmodeus? Or have you not understood that one cannot be judged for what they might do, but for what they have done? We may have given them life, but it was a gift, and a gift should not be taken back so lightly. We may neither unmake them for something they did not do themselves not for what danger they may pose. Or do you believe that we should have given ourselves to Asgorath when he demanded our lives for the slaying of Arambar, and we fled. Did you not yourself kill Atropus? If you will speak of justice then you must speak consistently."

And it came to a vote, and the vote was tied until Nebelum cast his final vote, and he voted on behalf of the mortals, and by the narrowest of margins the mortals were not undone.

And thus it was decreed, "The council shall not work together to unmake the planes."

And the brothers Tharizdun and Asmodeus spoke aside to one another, for they were of the same mind.

"Ah, the beauty of semantics," Asmodeus did not betray a hint of a smile, for he knew already what he would do, and he found no pleasure in it. He had decided that it was for the good of Arvandor that the mortals were to be undone, though he took no pleasure in the actual actions. "The council may have spoken. And it decrees that we shall not unmake the mortals as a collective. But they have not forbidden us from acting individually. The law is silent on this matter."

Gathering those gods who had once followed him and Tharizdun, Azmodeus laid out the plan to unmake life, to undo the very fabric of mortal existence.

But Hekate, the Mistress of Magic, was not so easily swayed. She had helped them take their revenge against the Raven Queen, because Hekate had despised her for abusing the gift she had been given. But she did not hate mortals. In secret, she reached out to the other gods, her thoughts weaving through the divine tapestry of Arvandor like tendrils of mist. "Beware," she warned. "Asmodeus and Tharizdun plot to exploit a loophole in the Council's decree. They seek to unmake life itself."

The gods were alarmed, and the Council was hastily reconvened, and not all the gods could come, and the gods that sided with Asmodeus made sure to stifle the message, so that they held a majority. 

Accusations and defenses filled the divine chamber. 

But they need not have bothered to form a majority. While many gods agreed that the mortals should not be unmade, they were not united in the belief that they should be actively protected. The council was at an impasse, and in the end, the council did nothing, its members dispersing in a cloud of frustration and resentment.

Asmodeus left and began to gather his allies, for he felt that he should act quickly, before the council again changed its mind. 

Hekate, for her part, returned to her arcane sanctum, her heart heavy with the burden of her secret knowledge. She knew that the council's inaction had set something irrevocable in motion.

Tharizdun returned to the Nine Hells, and he gloated before the Raven Queen. She listened. She had set this chain of events into motion, and yet she was powerless to stop it. And all she could do was watch. And this was an added torture to those she already endured.

"Wait!"

Thalorin's voice resonated through the celestial chamber, a clarion call that cut through the tension and indecision that had paralyzed the council. His siblings, Varian and Elandra, stood steadfast by his side

"Wait!" Thalorin commanded as the gods began to disperse. "I will not stand idly by while innocent blood is shed. Life should not be unmade. I urge you all, if the council has become so corrupt that it cannot govern, then abandon it! Its decisions need not be your own. Stand by me!"

And a few gods harkened to his words, and they went to him, and they defied the council, and said it was of no use. And thus they were no longer part of the council, and they were called the Protectors, and they marched out of the chamber.

And the remnants of the council whispered hastily, and this decision they reached before the Protectors had reached the door of the chamber: "You and your followers are hereby exiled from Arvandor. You choose to defy the council; therefore, you shall have no place in it."

And Thalorin said back, "Then let it be so," and left.

And he and his followers abandoned Arvandor forever. They descended to the Material Plane, where they would stand as guardians against the wrath of the betrayer gods, for so they named those that would follow Asmodeus.

And thus began the Sundered War.

## Sundered War

As the gods clashed in celestial realms, their conflict spilled over into the mortal plane. Mortals became unwitting pawns in this divine struggle, their lives and lands reshaped by the whims of their creators. Abominations, aberrations, and monstrous beasts were conjured into existence, each side crafting their own armies to strike at the other.

The age of peace that had once defined the cosmic order was shattered, replaced by an era of strife and chaos. Tartarus, the formidable Primordial, threw his lot in with the Betrayer gods, and his dark influence was felt in each battle, for though Akadi was elder than Tartarus, and she had left the council with Thalorin, she was far less potent than Tartarus.

The Betrayer gods, in their quest for dominion, began to unravel the threads of the Weave that held the Material Plane together. Their dark machinations were focused on destabilizing the world while preserving only the prison of Asgorath. In response, the Protectors tirelessly worked to reweave the fabric of reality, restoring what had been undone.

The gods sought to entrap one another, to banish their foes, and to exert their will upon the Weave. Each side fought to prevent the other from either unraveling or reweaving the world, resulting in a Material Plane that was in constant flux, its landscapes and inhabitants subject to the ever-changing whims of divine influence.

Weapons and artifacts of immense power were scattered across the mortal realm, each a remnant of the divine conflicts. The Lady of Pain, in a moment of cunning, trapped one of her foes in a gem known as the Labyrinth-Stone. Driven to madness within its confines, the gem was cast into the heart of a dense forest, its malevolent occupant forever sealed. Tiamat and Bahamut clashed in a battle that lasted a week, and during the fray, Tiamat's dagger was lost, plummeting into the molten core of a volcano. These lost artifacts became vestiges of great power, sought after by many mortals after the Sundered War. These lost artifacts became vestiges of great power, sought after by many mortals after the Sundered War.

As the gods waged war, they used the mortals as pawns, they created abominations and aberrations and beasts to strike at each other. Some gods turned to the lingering magic of Asgorath to create dragons. This ancient magic, still resonant in the mortal realm, found hosts in mortals and beasts. The gods nurtured this magic, transforming these hosts into lesser dragons—powerful beings that served as divine weapons. Tiamat, who was half-dragon, excelled in this art. Her dragons were the most fearsome, most closely resembling the Epic Dragons that had once roamed during the Eternal Wars.

The Sundered War spanned centuries, its toll immeasurable. The Betrayer gods, led by Asmodeus and Tharizdun, held a slight advantage, their forces bolstered by fiends, balrogs, and other dark creations. Slowly, the world began to unravel, and entire races were wiped from existence, their names forgotten even by the annals of history.

On the other side, the Protector gods, led by Thalorin, Varian, and Elandra, fought with valor but were consistently outnumbered. Despite their disadvantage, they held the line, their resilience a beacon of hope in a universe teetering on the brink of annihilation.

Yet, amidst the devastation, there remained a glimmer of hope. In the mortal realms, the seeds of resistance were sown, small flickers of light in a world overshadowed by divine conflict.

And the mortals remembered the Raven Queen.

And it was a mortal, Tyr, who because of his lesser status, could slip into the nine hells and evade the alarms and defenses that guarded the Raven Queen's prison. With deft skill, he unlocked her chains, and as they fell away, her power surged back, restoring her to the might she had wielded when she had slain the god of death. And he died soon thereafter, and the Raven Queen caught his soul as it fled, and in an act she could never replicate thereafter, she turned him into a god.

And the gods, needing help, accepted the Raven Queen and Tyr as allies.

Her arrival to the celestial battlefield was like a storm breaking. The Protector gods, their ranks now bolstered, began to turn the tide. A series of victories followed, each one pushing the Betrayer gods further back, until they were cornered in the Nine Hells.

The Protector gods clashed with the Betrayer gods in the depths of the Nine Hells. Finally, they managed to seal the Betrayer gods within the Nine Hells. 

## Aftermath

But the cost was staggering. The mortal realm lay in ruins, its landscapes scarred, its peoples decimated. Entire races had been wiped out, their histories erased. Artifacts of immense power lay scattered, their locations known only to the few who dared to seek them. The gods themselves were forever changed, their unity shattered, their trust in each other irrevocably broken.

Yet, in the midst of this devastation, there was a glimmer of hope. The loyal gods had prevailed, and the Betrayer gods were sealed away. The Raven Queen, once a symbol of sorrow and regret, had become a beacon of resilience and redemption.

Hekate, the goddess who had bestowed the gift of magic upon mortals, took a final, decisive action. With a spell of unparalleled complexity, she conjured Trees of Sanctuary|two trees—one in the Material Plane and another in the Plane of Air. These were no ordinary trees; their branches stretched through the very fabric of the planes, reaching to the farthest corners of the Material Realm and beyond.

In the Material Plane, the tree was known as the Tree of Stars, its branches shimmering with golden celestial light. In the Plane of Air, it was called the Tree of Echoes, because it held in it the echoes of the last work of complete divine magic in the material Plane.

The gods, whether they were Protectors, Betrayers, or those who had abandoned the cause, found themselves unable to pass through the intricate weave of the trees' branches.

However, lesser beings like mortals could navigate through the leaves, slipping between the planes, but only a few, who had that power. For it was more difficult than it once had been, and the old doors and ways no longer worked. And thus many families and friends were separated, as some were left in the Gentle Zephyr, the Plane of Air, while others were left in the Prison of Asgorath, the Material Plane.

The Raven Queen, her power restored but her soul forever scarred, returned to her Palace of Memories in the Shadowfell. There, she continued her eternal vigil over memories and stories, a bittersweet sanctuary amidst the chaos.

The Protector gods, still exiled from Arvandor and locked out by the unyielding council, found a new home. They crafted The Seven Heavens in the quasi-plane situated between the Material Plane and the distant Elysium. In these celestial realms, they dwelt, forever separated from their original divine abode, and they called themselves the Righteous Council. Tyr joined them there, and they accepted him as one of their own.

The Betrayer gods, led by Asmodeus and Tharizdun, remained trapped in the Nine Hells. Among them was Tartarus, who longed to return to Shar in the Abyss. And Shar would break open the nine hells so that he would be free, but Selune, in Elysium, held her back. The light of Selune served as a barrier against the encroaching darkness of Shar.

And the Raven Queen begged of the gods in the seven heavens to aid her. With the Astral Plane shattered, the Raven Queen wished to open the Seven Heavens to the souls of the departed. Her plea was granted, and the souls found a new sanctuary.

However, the souls of those who had committed evil deeds in life were claimed by the Betrayer gods. The Protector gods could not intervene, for these souls had willingly chosen a path of darkness, and in death their path could no longer be altered. Rather than let them be consumed by the Abyss, it was deemed better for them to dwell in the Nine Hells.

And so, a new cosmic balance was established. The Seven Heavens and the Nine Hells became the final resting places for souls, each realm reflecting the choices made in life. The Trees of Sanctuary continued to stand as barriers, maintaining the delicate balance between divine and mortal realms.


---

Now, when the betrayer gods first struck at mortals, they struck Thalassos, for Varian had spoken against the unmaking of mortals, and Azmodeus wished for revenge, and not a mortal in there had time to react or call for help. No alarm was raised. Few of the Anami lived past that day. And the regent, named Anamos, the fourth regent of that name, lay dead on the battlements of Mycenae.

And Varian, came down and saw his people killed and he was incensed, and would have fought Tharizdun on the spot, but his brother Thalorin advised him to go first to the council, or else they may lose any hope of alliance and peace between the gods.

But the Sundering War began.

And Eldorath fell soon thereafter, and Nebelum, who had until then argued for a peaceful end to the war, was angered then, and left Arvandor and fought alongside Thalorin against the betrayers.

But the borders of the Dravaran were protected at first by the great magics of their king.

They harbored survivors for some time, and their people fought against the betrayers, and Tal'berius and Artorius fought bravely in the war, becoming known as an unstoppable duo of forces. 

Tharizdun railed against the wards of Tar-Rilion, and though he could not pass them, his creations could, and a great plague swept the land, and young Nanor, still but a child, fell ill and died. Rillion, consumed by anger and grief, then flew to meet Tharizdun in battle and was slain, and the wards fell. 

His two sons rushed back to protect their kingdom and avenge their father and sister. They challenged Tharizdun in the valley of Echoriath, and they held him back. For eight hours they fought, and in the eighth hour Artorius sacrificed himself to save his brother, and as Tharizdun gloated, Tal'berius struck deep into Tharizdun's heart, imbuing his grief over the deaths of his brother and his sister and his father into a work of magic so powerful it undid the bindings that kept Azgorath chained and opened a rift into Pandemonium itself, the realm outside of time and space where the Queen of Chaos dwells.

Tal'berius carved out the heart of Tharizdun for himself, and as the god still lived, Tal'berius dragged him down to the nine hells and chained him with his own chains. He contained the rift into Chaos in an orb made of glass forged in Order, and hid it deep in a dungeon of his own construction, and Tal'berius retreated from the world of mortals for a long time.

Though the rift was gone, the bindings of the world were made loose, and great amount of chaotic energies transformed the region, and war between the gods scattered the people.
