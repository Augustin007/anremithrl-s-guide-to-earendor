(~0-~1800 AS)
Age of Wandering:

kobolds emerge as deformities from the draconic magic first poured in to contain the rift.

People are scattered, don't know what is going on. Most information is lost. Several species are extinct from the sundering war and the time after it. The elves mantain their dominance as a mortal species.

Eleutheros and Feullin studied the residual magical energies from the Sundered War, developing spells to cleanse and rejuvenate the land
The Faeries, who fought under Asmodeus, are hated. But Asmodeus gives them a last gift to help them escape into small pockets between the planes with illusions. The gnomes who fought against their creator, are forgiven.  The faeries are slowly forgiven over time, but never trusted. The Faeries often curse or bless people who interfere with them, creating several of the beastfolk.

As the last skirmishes are fought, small kingdoms begin to arise again.

Small kingdoms and tribes begin to trade and share knowledge, forming the foundation for future empires.

(~1600 AS): **Shattering of Shadows Campaign**: In the valley of Echoriath in the Shattered Region, different tribes settle their differences and unite to form the Kesnan Kingdom and deal with the threats of the early age of Shadows. 
In the Shattered Region, Sereth optimized troop deployments and such. Supply lines.

In the North of Foedus, a priest of Thalorin, Malthos studied the Sundered War and wrote much on it. He formed a temple near the edge of the lake surrounding the Tree of Names, and devoted his life to tending to the tree ad protecting it. His disciples followed him, and descendents took up the mantle after them, devoted to fighting off the darkness. This is the Order of Names.

Varian was long gone, and the library of Eldorath was no more. Those who remained were scattered far and wide across the region. And it was impassable and difficult to survive there. It became filled with deep ravines, jagged mountains, and winding rivers. Few places had fertile land and many animals had died. Storms of pure chaos were common and dangerous. The survivors faced an impassable and inhospitable environment. The place became known as the shattered teeth.

With cities no longer tenable, people grouped together into nomadic tribes, each striving for survival in a harsh and unpredictable world. The remnants of the once-great civilizations now wandered, scavenging for resources and moving frequently to find sustenance.

In the centuries following the Sundering, the tribes of the Shattered Teeth adapted to their environment. They developed new ways of living, relying on their knowledge of the land and the remnants of ancient magic. Fertile land was scarce, so agriculture was limited. Instead, they turned to hunting, gathering, and scavenging.

Despite the chaos, the tribes managed to preserve aspects of their cultural heritage. Oral traditions and storytelling became vital in maintaining their history and identity. Artisans continued to create, and warriors passed down their skills to new generations. The spirit of the old civilizations lived on through these efforts.

Among these tribes, a tribe formed of some of the remnants of the Anami, were led by a man named Sorian. Sorian remembered the great universities and libraries that once existed. He remembered the library of Eldorath and the great works of magic. They came to the ruins of Mycenae and rebuilt what they could, and they were lucky, for the land there was still somewhat fertile, and they were the first to build again cities.

Sorian then founded an order devoted to recovering of pre-sundering magic and knowledge. He traded many goods, tools, and food in exchange for scavenged items. Deep in the mines he constructed a great vault, and insulated it against what magic he could. After his death, Eledor headed the order after Sorian's death, and they became known as the Cobalt order, for the vast mines of Cobalt.

Now, the tribes fought often among each other over their many resources. Vorrak was the leader of a tribe consisting of seventy-two men, soldiers who had fought in the Sundered War. They hoarded weapons and aided tribes in exchange for resources. They took captives, and married into other tribes to form alliances. They became known as the Vorokai.

Thalen was the leader of the Rassac, who were also remnants of the Amani. They allied themselves with the Vorokai, but they dealt in poisons and stealth tactics.

The Age of Wandering was a time of profound dislocation and uncertainty, a direct consequence of the celestial cataclysm known as the Sundered Wars. The very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving behind a landscape of shattered kingdoms and broken dreams.

- **Mass Migrations**: The most defining feature of this age was the mass movement of peoples across the Ephemeral Lands. Entire communities, now bereft of their ancestral homes, took to the roads as nomads. They crossed mountains, forded rivers, and braved the newly-formed wastelands in search of places to settle.
  
- **Rediscovery and Loss**: As these nomadic tribes wandered, they stumbled upon the ruins of ancient civilizations, their grandeur now buried under the weight of time and calamity. Libraries had been razed, and centers of learning destroyed. The loss of ancient knowledge was palpable, but it also gave rise to a new form of oral tradition. Storytellers, shamans, and lorekeepers became the new custodians of history, passing down tales of the Sundered Wars and the world that once was.
  
- **Survival of the Fittest**: In a world stripped of its former glory, only the hardiest could survive. This was a time of great strife but also of incredible innovation. New methods of agriculture were developed, rudimentary forms of governance emerged, and the first semblances of organized religion began to take shape. 
  
- **First Settlements**: Towards the end of the Age of Wandering, the first stable settlements began to appear. These were often located near vital resources like rivers, fertile land, or mineral deposits. The most successful of these would eventually grow into the great cities and kingdoms of the next age.

- **Cultural Synthesis**: The constant movement and interaction among different tribes and races led to a rich tapestry of cultural exchange. New languages were born, artistic styles merged, and pantheons of gods expanded as deities from different cultures were integrated into shared religious practices.

The Age of Wandering was a crucible in which the future of the Ephemeral Lands was forged. It was a time of hardship, but also one of immense possibility. The lessons learned during these trying times laid the groundwork for the ages that would follow, each building upon the last in the ongoing saga of the mortal realm.

The Age of Wandering began to end when the first whispers of Shar were heard, and it was said that it's true end was when the first mortal war occurred.

The Dragon Glaumhot was formed by Tiamat.
