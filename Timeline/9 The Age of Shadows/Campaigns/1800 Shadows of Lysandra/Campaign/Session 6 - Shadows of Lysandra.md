[[Session 5 - Shadows of Lysandra |<-prev]]
While most believe them inocent, Sir Markov does lay accusations that they murdered the two others. Remours begin to spread across the order.

Meanhile, they look for reports of these ships, listening to things. They find some mentions of Lorien Voss on Baelor's correspondance, but can't ask him what it is.

They decide to head to Crantaa, following leads in the reports that the black ship was seen heading that way some days ago. Knowing it doesn't stay in one place long, they decide to take a more dangerous faster route to the docks, they get attacked by monsters, and Orris dies.
