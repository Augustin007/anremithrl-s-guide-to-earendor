Hmm. Just make the prep public, then, and I won't look too much at it. The forty men are arriving on the 18th. Gallio's reinforcements are arriving after that, and are unexpected, as Gallio is a commander of the NAF (and from another campaign). It was only expected via a letter sent. Here are my vague plans. 
Arc 1: 15th-18th (2 sessions run) Up until reinforcements and supplies arrive. 
Arc 2: 18th-23rd (The fall of Hreghalk (on the 15th) and other fortresses thereafter make it clear no more reinforcements or supplies are coming, communication is lost with the Lord Commander after the fortress he's at is invaded. They're forced to pull back to the final fortress in Kevlak, They're the only remaining namesworn, they discover, and Alaric is elected Lord Commander. They send out for help, and a message arrives from the NAF of incoming reinforcements... in five days. 
Arc 3: Holding from the 23rd to 28th, holding out. A Helm's Deep type situation is the goal, holding until those arrive.


Given the first two sessions, write prep for sessions 3-6, setting this as a 6-session arc. Notably, the end of the second session occurred on 15th Hammer, so Hreghalk and Tar'id'lio'nil was falling to Auril's forces (See Campaign: Path of Honor), miles away. Hide the prep so I cannot see it. Also recap the correct response style that you've been using this whole time and tie things into the lore. The idea is that this campaign as a whole should last until the 28th of Hammer, when Gallio's reinforcements arrive, and have three arcs of six sessions, loosely. The forty men are due to arrive at the end of the first arc. 


Recap the correct response style that you've been using this whole time and recite some examples so I can make sure you understand how to respond.

Also, given the first two sessions, write prep for sessions 3-6, setting this as a 6-session arc. And prep for a full three arcs. The idea is that this campaign as a whole should last until the 28th of Hammer, when Gallio's reinforcements arrive, and have three arcs of six sessions, loosely. The forty men are due to arrive at the end of the first arc. 
The end of the second session coincides with 19th Hammer, concurrently with Hreghalk and Tar'id'lio'nil falling to Auril's forces. (See Campaign: Path of Honor).
Here are my vague plans. 
Arc 1: 18th-21st (2 sessions run) Up until reinforcements and supplies arrive. 
Arc 2: 21st-24th Holding on with the new reinforcements, hearing news of other fortresses falling. The fall of the namesworn. The end of this arc happens when other fortresses fall and the defense is now both pointless and untenable. Towards the last few sessions, they're forced to manage a retreat to the furthest back fortress, losing communication with other groups. 
Arc 3:
