The Echoriati Number System: "Zharil"

The Zharil number system is deeply influenced by the cycles of the moon and the significance of certain numbers in Echoriati culture. It’s a base-7 system, which aligns with their 7-day week and the mystical importance of the number 7 in their traditions. The system is used in both daily life and ceremonial contexts, with unique symbols for each digit.
Numerals and Counting

1. Basic Digits (0-6):
Digit	Echoriati Numeral	Pronunciation
0	O	"Oth"
1	A	"Ar"
2	Z	"Zeth"
3	E	"Eth"
4	R	"Rin"
5	V	"Vor"

    49: "Gorisar" (7 x 7; considered a powerful and mystical number)

    100: "Zhar" (Ultimate base number, equivalent to 49 in decimal)

Structure and Pronunciation

Number Formation:

    Numbers are typically written with the most significant digit first, just like in our system.

    Examples:

        13 (in base-7): Sarieth ("Sari" for 7 + "Eth" for 3)

        25 (in base-7): Sarizarvor ("Sarizar" for 14 + "Vor" for 5)

        56 (in base-7): Gorisarvor ("Gorisar" for 49 + "Vor" for 5)

Symbolism of Numbers

    1 ("A"/"Ar"): Represents beginnings, individual strength, and leadership.

    Sacred Numbers: Numbers like 49 (7 x 7) and 28 (4 x 7) hold special significance in rituals and ceremonies. For instance, a Gorisar (49-day) period might be used for a significant rite of passage or a time of mourning.

Example Usages

    "There are 21 warriors."

        "Anan sarivar rokan."

    "The temple was built in 49 days."

        "Thalizhn es gorisar dathan."

Year System: "Years Since the Sundering" (YS)

In the Echoriati culture, time is often measured in relation to the Sundering, a cataclysmic event that reshaped their world. The years are counted "Since the Sundering" (YS), marking this pivotal event as the central point in their historical timeline.
Terminology and Usage

    "Before the Sundering" (BS): Years that occurred before the Sundering.

        Echoriati term: "Thurzan" (Derived from "Thur" meaning ancient and "Zan" meaning time)

        Example: 50 BS = "Thurzan 50"

    "Since the Sundering" (YS): Years that have passed since the Sundering.

        Echoriati term: "Zanith" (Derived from "Zan" meaning time and "Ith" implying a continuation)

    The Sundering event itself is denoted as Year 0.

        Year 0: The Sundering, marking the divide between Thurzan and Zanith.

        1 YS (Zanith 1): The first year after the Sundering.

        100 YS (Zanith 100): The centennial anniversary of the Sundering.

        500 BS (Thurzan 500): A date 500 years before the Sundering.

Historical and Cultural Significance
