From time untamed, to time made whole,  
There echoes roll, and stars ignite,  
Before the dawn of space and name,  
There was no frame, nor dark nor light.

Then from the first, the cause unknown,  
A seed was sown, and order spun,  
From naught they came, the twain divine,  
Both course and line, both void and sun.

Ao the king of order wrought,  
A boundless thought, of law and plane,  
And Isfet danced through time untied,  
With endless stride, and unchained reign.

Yet soon they wove in silver thread,  
A place where fled, the still and swirled,  
An almost-place, an almost-time,  
A fleeting chime, a turning world.

And from this womb of space unformed,  
A pair was born, with sky and shade,  
Selûne bright, with lantern’s glow,  
Her shadow low, where Shar had laid.

Then next arose two mighty minds,  
The Cosmic Twins, the great and vast,  
Asgorath shaped the woven winds,  
And Arambar held firm and fast.

They bent the void to take its form,  
They shaped the storm, they shaped the flow,  
With steady hands they laid the frame,  
And spoke its name, that all might know.

Then four arose, in shifting might,  
With solid height and fluid speed,  
With flame to burn, with air to dance,  
The elder chance, the primal seed.

Grumbar slow, the stone unturned,  
Istishia churned, the water vast,  
Kossuth burned in molten gold,  
And Akadi laughed upon the blast.

Each shaped a plane, their realms unfurled,  
With force and will, with time and tide,  
And where they walked, the world was built,  
With law and guilt, with fate as guide.

Yet dusk was born in shadow’s wake,  
With secrets great, and silent vow,  
For from the edges of the world,  
The dusk unfurled, in embered bough.

Dur-baagal cold and cruel he came,  
And Atropus, the eater fell,  
And Tartarus in void did wait,  
To twist their fate and weave their spell.

Then war was cast in heaven’s shade,  
And blade to blade, the titans fell,  
The Dawn enraged, the Dusk conspired,  
With wrath and pyre, in endless knell.

With faithless whispers Shar did weave,  
With tangled sleeve she spun her snare,  
And so the twins beheld the loss,  
The shattered gloss, the world laid bare.

Atropus struck, his hunger vast,  
He tore the past, he sundered space,  
Dur-baagal froze the ebb of time,  
His work sublime, a stillborn grace.

Then grief unmade the threads of peace,  
The war increased, the bounds were torn,  
The stars unshaped, the heavens bled,  
Where once they tread, where gods were born.

The Celestials rose in boundless flame,  
They struck the name of Dusk in woe,  
The war was long, and none stood true,  
For all withdrew, as tides would flow.

And dragons vast of Chaos came,  
With breath aflame, with talons bright,  
And Order too, with steel untamed,  
No god unmaimed, no void left white.

And in the end, a prison spun,  
With stars undone, and fate confined,  
The Titans fell, the war was sealed,  
A fate revealed, a world designed.

The Material Plane, their crafted snare,  
Lay bound with care, a silent keep,  
Asgorath chained, his dreams were dim,  
His echoes grim, in tethered sleep.

The gods arose to rule the land,  
Their guiding hand, both just and frail,  
Yet whispers still of chaos deep,  
Where shadows creep, and bindings fail.

And so the world was shaped with might,  
In dawn and night, in fire and storm,  
Yet time still turns, and fates still weave,  
And none reprieve the world’s reform.

For war is never truly done,  
And fate is spun in threads unknown,  
And stars will rise, and stars will fall,  
Yet still they call from worlds outgrown.
