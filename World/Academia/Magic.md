## Mechanics
### Introduction
Weave, quiddity, motion, and matter were discovered to be the same thing by Ghalen, and named energy, and its consistency and conservation gives us Ghalen's Laws.

1. An object shall always minimise its movement across the fold metric.
2. Energy is consistent and conserved across all interactions. 
The weave is the most relevant form of energy, for our purposes. 

The smallest element of weave is called a Thread.

Thread can connect with other threads by 'folding'. This creates a twine with another thread. The various twines are based on different folds of threads, affecting how connected two threads are.

### Twine Topology and Fold Metric

The more astute among you know, perhaps, that these twinings are the basis for time and space itself, but I think it is a worthy endeavour to understand how and why. 

1. twining is strong enough to compose, and thus gives us the standard axioms, of finite intersection, arbitrary union, with certain restrictions.
2. Each of these twinings is called open. And fulfills all properties of weave on its own. Each complement is closed.

This gives us the idea of connectivity, that being, any open twining is connected if and only if the only subtwining that are both open and closed are the complete twining and the empty twining.

Each maximal connected twining is called a component.

Any two threads on a component have folds that are at least compositionally entwined. 
If you take the inverse of the strength of twining across the component, you get a metric.
F(a,b) which measures how distant two twines are.

By any measure, the twining of something and itself is unbounded, so we can call this meter to be empty. The metric F is symmetric, and the limitation of twining can be seen now, as open intervals from a thread, by limiting this metric, and the following of the following inequality, that F(a,b)+F(b,c)q≥F(a,b). This is Neumann's inequality, and a defining property of a metric space. The fold metric was chosen so that all twines would be open subsets of the topology generated by the fold metric. 

Another limitatoin of twining, which is not yet understood is that every spot is locally isomorphic to at most ℝ¹². Finally, there is maximum speed of transferring and establishing folds and twines, which warp time in certain ways when pushed. This can be observed in the speed of light, as light passes through threads as fast as it can.

From here you can construct charts and atlases and smooth manifolds onto this topology. 

### Matter and Motion

Matter is physical matter, which you see before you. I assume you are familiar with what exactly is matter. The metric and topology described on the threads give it a space on which to exist. Matter is excess energy tied to threads, in a sort of frozen state. It can move between threads. The interaction between threads and matter gives us what we usually call space and time.

Matter can hold quiddity, and is 'at' a thread. (As far as it can be 'at' a thread.)

Motion, finally, is the transference of matter from one point to another, always a straight line.
And a line is called straight if it is the shortest path between two points along the Fold Metric described above.

That is, motion prefers to function between stronger twines and all matter is always in some amount of motion. 
### Quiddity

Now, the actual folds have to be composed of some form of charge, or energy. This is called the quiddity. There are a lot of forms of quiddity, and along twines we measure them as points on an individual axis.

This axis is usually referred to as an axon to distinguish it from usual axi, which give dimension to a space and create a vector field. A thread that is part of a nontrivial component cannot have arbitrary vector operations. The arbitrary vector operations on severed threads collapse into known axons over certain probability fields when interacted with. We do not know why this is the case, and experiments are incredibly difficult and unreliable, as severed threads are effectively inaccessible, and no longer connected to our world, and reconnecting them almost impossible.

There are many axons, with names for the two opposite energies that mark them, but four are of particular note: the Singular Axon, and the three Primary Axons.
The three primary axons are these: Draw, Field, and Entropic axons.

#### Draw Axon
The first primary axon is the draw axon. The two forms of quiddity that are along it are the Arcane and Ancient. They each come equiped with one fold, which is named S for arcane, and A for ancient. By tradition, in measuring, Arcane is placed at the positive numbers and its opposite ancient is measured with negative numbers.

Now, the interactions that these twines have mean that excess ancient quiddity on two ends of a twine contracts the twining. So that what appears to be a curved line is actually a straight line upon the metric.

Bending space this way is called 'applying a force'. This particular effect, between SS, AA, and AS pairings is known to us as gravity. 

The exact same occurs with two objects of arcane quiddity. Across the two opposite ends they curve away from each other. 

In contrast to this position, mass, which measures the draw axon on matter denotes ancient as positive, and things suffused with arcane have negative mass.

These double conventions are sometimes confusing and one would wish for a Time Machine to change the mind of whoever came up with it.

#### Field Axon
The next axon is the Field axon, which contains divine and draconic axons. There are four primary folds of the Field axon expressed in matter, which are posup, podun, nup, and nun. 
The divine direction is noted as positive here.

D⁺↑,D⁺↓,D⁻↑,D⁻↓
Divine Posup, podun, nup, nun.

R⁺↑,R⁺↓,R⁻↑,R⁻↓
Draconic Posup, podun, nup, nun.

Their interactions give us the Eryic Forces, known to some as electricity and magnetism.
As well as the strong and weak nuclear forces when combined with the Draw axon. 
Matter, unlike threads, can (and typically does) hold axi as opposed to axon quiddities, that is, capable of holding more than one at once. Most matter holds just ancient and divine. This combination gives us the standard interactions between matter.

For magnets, the angular spin state (up or down) is irrelevant, so thus there are four magnets.

For example: D⁺
- attracts D⁻
- ignores R⁺
- repels D⁺ and R⁻

Simple differences in internal interactions and the amount of ambient ancient in the primary component actually create a weak but existent repellance between divine pos and draconic pos, but that is because of properties of the primary component and does not hold true of other componenets.

#### Entropic Axon
The final primary axon is the entropic one. Chaos and Order. Again, since Chaos is more easily noticed, it has become the positive form in measurement.

Order is the force of cold, of slowness. Of capture. It has the tendency to negate other axons, almost slow down time. It prefers things unchanging. Its interactions with other axons mostly serve to nullify the other axon. It can be used to slow axon or stop interactions. It has a single fold, denoted O.

Chaos is the inversion of this. Chaos, of course, is the force of extreme heat. It boosts the connections between axons. Speed. With unpredictable folds that seem to follow no pattern. Its behaviour seems to be erratic and confusing. It's folds are denoted X[c] where c represents a 3 by 4 matrix.

### Singular Axon
The singular axon is the most important. 

It's folds are incredibly strange. No twines have ever been detected, but the effects of them can be detected. One moment something will change from one state to another, transmitting power and leaving behind a trace of twines that seem to have been created and undone in a moment, but all attempts to actually detect the folds while active have eluded everyone. Analysis of the trace seem to show that it is a twine with 0 strength, yet capable of fast transference. 

This has two quiddities, known as Positive and Negative, mostly, or Life and Death. No known folds.

On the physical side of things, its effects have been better studied.

This Axon serves as the method of binding your soul to your body, connecting your mind and soul. When you die, usually the quiddity disperses. Positive magic binds living things to their soul. It's the force that channels will and intent from the soul into the body.

It also serves as your connection to the magic around you. This is why, even though spells require 'folding' billions of threads around you, in complicated ways, you can still do it. Positive magic stores your edict, your goal, sharing it with folds around you, twining them to you. It has memory. 

It protects living beings from outside magic. Because of this, Negative magic is the only way to directly affect someone with magic against their will. 

Negative magic is the Anti-life force. The source of curses, It can directly can eat at the positive magic that binds your soul to your body, destroying it. Directly killing you, while your body remains alive. 

Now, your soul does regenerate its bond, as long as there isn't a source of Negative magic balanced. And, instead of channeling intent and will, it absorbs it. This is why creatures resurrected with negative magic do not have their own willpower or intent, they are undead, connected via negative magic to the person who raised them, unable to have any willpower or intent.

As no folds are known, there are no forces it applies to matter. These are forces in metaphor only. The forces of life and death. Of willpower.

The Singular Axon is the only true bit of magic here. Everything else is just physics.

#### Nonstandard Axons
All other axons are too individually rare and totally numerous to be of particular note. 
The most noteworthy nonstandard axons are the Void and Marethic axons, which are the two null axons.

Void axons create N-folds. There are more than one kind, though unpredictable, Void folds prevent other folds from affecting a thread, and are used in bursts to sever threads from a component. It is the only manufactured fold, and does not occur naturally as far as is known. It is always in a Null state (that is, 0 energy), and cannot absorb any. It was created trying to replicate Singular Quiddity twines. It tends to collapse, unless continually supplied with energy. The power tends form at the borders into ordered twines, but rarely collapses into different twines instead, except the Marethic and Singular axon, but this process is not yet understood.

The Marethic axon is markedly similar to the Singular axon. It produces a single fold, called the M-fold, and is always in a null state. Much of its behaviour is similar to Singular Axon, and the fold was once thought to be the Singular fold. It cannot affect will or intent, but it does seem to be able to hold oaths, the same way positive does. It is not quiddic. It only appears in creations of Marethyu.

Other named nonstandard axons are Ex, Reflective, and Invert axons. There is not yet a known pattern to nonstandard axons, so we cannot estimate how many there are, or how to reference them.

### Collapse
When large amounts of opposing quiddities touch, there is a collapse and conversion of energy. The exception to this is the Singular Axon, which simply eat at each other until one is gone.

Collapse occurs when two opposing quiddities of the same axon occupy the same region of matter. At the thread level this is impossible: the twining laws forbid opposing charges from inhabiting the same twine. They simply cancel, removing the twine. This is fortunate, otherwise the ambient ancient magic would collapse our soul-bond's springwell.

#### Draw Collapse
When Arcane and Ancient charges coincide, the opposing curvatures neutralise each other. The local twining shortens, and involved threads are converted into energy. The released energy does not disperse as heat or light but remains bound within the metric itself. They reexpress themselves as matter, tying themselves to new threads.

Now, this matter called UnKeyed matter. It is actually initially weightless, conductive, nonmagnetic, and amorphic. It is not formed of standard particles. By the connection to threads around it, properties will transfer via thread osmosis, and it will almost immediately key itself to become regular matter. 

An imbalance of initial arcane or ancient in the does result in some weight, and properties.

Since this interaction can only occur in matter, the osmosis makes it take on similar ratios of base matter particles as the rest of the matter. That is, if this interaction occurs inside of gold, you would expect the resulting mess of atoms and subatomic particles to total ratios of about 79 protons and 79 neutrons for every 118 neutrons, though it is unlikely it will actually form into pure gold. Its initial instability makes it prone to be radioactive.

#### Entropic Collapse
Along the Entropic axon, the interactions often release as a creating new threads with folds along seemingly random axons and quiddities, including Chaotic or Ordered, and excepting Marethic, Null, and Singular. Many nonstandard axons have been discovered this way. While the material the reaction takes place in seems to affect this, it is still not well understood. Besides this it releases a large amount of heat.

#### Field Collapse
Field collapse is the most dramatic of all.
Divine and Draconic charges repel one another across the threads, so they are extremely difficult to force together but if confined in matter they are compelled into proximity by the material’s own twining. They usually generate a small non quiddic surface between them rather than touch.
When they are forced to meet meet, the opposing orientations shear their common folds apart. This will split apart even matter, tearing apart atoms. The result is a chain reaction: each newly unbound thread releases further Field charge, spreading collapse through the surrounding matter until no opposing quiddities remain. The visible effects are brightness, heat, and the disintegration of material cohesion. A release of a massive amount of motion and pure energy. Even small quantities can suffice.

(The present Ashfall is an instance of such Field collapse: Draconic quiddity channeled into ley lines of Divine composition, tearing the upper atmosphere into incandescent dust.)

Energy is never lost, only translated between the forms of matter, thread, motion, and quiddity.

### Additional Notes
Energy does sort of decay into usable forms and get transferred around. The constant weakening of thread folds is what causes the continuous expansion of the universe as the result of the metric grows bigger. 
The effects are equally conserved, such that interactions in most planes decay by a square factor of distance, that is, something twice as far will need four times the energy to have the same effect.
Though the topology and metric does affect this, as the surface of open twinings  may no longer be precisely two dimensional. This is what makes certain laws of physics vary around planes and around areas that connect planes, such as portals, rifts, or leaps. 
Analogues to CPT parity exist as well. Flipping divine and ancient onto draconic and arcane works almost exactly the same, though minor differences occur, but if you also flip spin, fold, use antimatter, and run it backward, the total thing is indistiguishable.
CPTDR-Parity.
### Magic, Edict, and Spellcasting

When the Singular Axon binds a living soul to its body, Positive quiddity acts as a memory lattice, storing the traces of thought and intent. Every living thing carries, within that lattice,  the things it desires, remembers, and fears. Its willpower. This is called its Edict. 

Positive quiddity is not passive. It forms folds according to its edict, as long as it has power within it, It resists alteration and defends its established configurations. This is why spells are difficult to change once learned, and why forgotten spells can sometimes “reassert” themselves under stress.

For this reason it is nearly impossible to cast a spell directly on another being, without negative quiddity to consume the positive one.

Positive quiddity does not exist only in living things. It suffuses nearly all threads, faintly. Because of this, there is memory of the past everywhere. Intent. Remnants of past edicts. For this reason it is easier, for example, to convert something into stone if you have a stone already. The stone already has the intent of being a stone, and you can more easily transfer it to new matter than you can recreate the edict of stone from scratch in your mind. 

Powerful spells often leave lingering intent. Remnants of the former Edict. 

A battlefield may leave fear and anger in its wake, felt by people who walk it years later. The same protection spells cast every day get easier and easier to create. They linger for longer and longer. Even a place that has been protected again and again physically may be slightly harder to attack magically. 

The strongest known example of this is the Draconic Intent. When Arambar and Asgorath created the dragons, their spells shaped the draconic quiddity so strongly that every bit of draconic quiddity everywhere knows what a dragon is, to some extent, and tries to create them. This leads to dragons and dragonborn and dragonblessed.

Splinters of Telos created the Genasi in the same way. Lingering intent also makes Runes function, as once they were used to help communicate edicts and store spells, the continued relation between runes and edicts has slowly grown. 

The Soulbond acts as a bond between the soul and matter, but it is capable of infusing itself with other quiddities. 

The positive energy's constant protection from ambient ancient magic generates a small amount of arcane energy. This is what is used to feed your edicts once you release the spell. The ability to store magic is called the springwell. The strength of the springwell determines your connection to magic, which is distinct from the strength of your soulbond.
Generally, with constant filling and emptying of the springwell, it will increase in size.
Now, most edicts are usually too vague and complex to be useable, as it would require a vast amount of power to handle it, and it likely wouldn't do what you want. Unless you have a powerful springwell, magic will never occur without direct guidance of your own edict.
People with that kind of springwell are called Sorcerers. And their magic is wild and uncontrollable, for the most part.

The soulbond and springwell together are called the spirit, and govern interactions between the soul and body. 

This gives the names of quiddities more clarity. The Primordials have springwells of ancient quiddity, the Celestials and Elessar and other gods have that of Divine, the Dragons have one of Draconic.

Arcane, though, to mortals. Which named it such before the nature of quiddity was understood.

There are a variety of exceptions. Hecate is, for instance, filled with arcane.

It takes careful crafting to form an edict that can actually do what you want. Practice and intuition and iteration.  Learning and preparing spells is rather to learn existing and discovered edicts that are actually effective, and to imprint them onto your spirit, so that they can actually be cast in a reasonable amount of time rather than attempting to rewrite the spell on the fly, as creating a usable edict usually takes weeks of tweaking. Some spells have taken years or even centuries. This connection to the mind, through lingering intent makes language or motions relevant, which is why some spells require utterances and motions.

## Spellcasting

It takes practice to actually shape an edict. Particularly if you want it to actually do what you want. 

Have you ever tried to move your ears? There are muscles that let you do this, but many people cannot, it requires fine muscle control. It's tricky to learn for many people. You can train yourself, though. You engage these muscles slightly when you smile. You can pay attention, isolate them, practice them.

Most beings have the capacity to affect the weave around them. Like a muscle, it has to build up strength. While some actions you have can have effects on the weave, it takes a lot more effort to feel, use, control, and shape the weave around you. 

It takes energy, mental effort, and very fine control to actually shape an edict. Casting many spells will leave you exhausted physically and mentally.

Once you have shaped an Edict, the correct folds and intents all in your mind at once, you have to push it into existence, feeding it with your springwell. You can set up a spell in the weave without releasing it, and even undo or diffuse a shape that has not been released. Releasing a spell to early might have strange results.

### Imprinting
You can imprint an edict onto your spirit. It slowly fades, and is usually gone after sleep. More practice allows you to make imprints take less of your focus and energy, allowing you to squeeze more imprints onto your spirit. 

One does not actually need to cast the spell in order to imprint it, as one can only set it up in the weave without releasing it. This still takes effort. 

Ritual casting refers to the direct construction of an edict, as opposed to using an imprinted one. It is a slow and tedious process.

### Practicality
While in theory you can construct edicts on the fly and feed them with your own magical energy, to do whatever you want, your mental capacity and springwell would have to be enormous. This is really only possible for a few deities.

Edicts need to be crafted carefully to actually do what you want. Trying to change an edict's behaviour on the fly takes massive amounts of energy. The right folds and intent need to be layered in ahead of time, and in just the right way to make sure it does not require as much energy to do what it has to do. Ideally it is a flexible edict, able to take in a variety of intents.

Research into edicts, little tweaks to things, trying to use different components as materials and foci, trying to make it do things in a more effective way, is an incredibly important branch. This branch of study has led to the Prestidigitation spell. A perfectly crafted edict able to be imprinted and cast by most everybody with a flexible intent that covers a lot of everyday and household uses, such as cleaning, enhancing taste, and others. Or mending, which leverages the original intent of the creation to try to repair an object.

While certain theoretical combinations of folds can do powerful things, creating an edict that actually does this can prove incredibly difficult. 

### Schools
Different fields of study study magic and different properties. These are: Evocation, which uses arcane magic to kickstart ancient reactions leveraging lingering intent and energy from the elemental planes; Conjuring, to conjure items and creatures from other planes or locations; Planurgy, the art of manipulating twinings to alter the resulting topology and metric, creating pockets where gravity, space, time, or other constants of nature can be temporarily modified; Echo tapping, which revolves around coaxing lingering intent into action; Illusions, creating temporary fragile structures of the weave known as illusions and glamours which are used to fake light, sound, and even feel of things; Transmutation, where you create an edict that alters the atomic structure of something; arithmancy, the study of the predictable logic interactions of threads to create fold gates and computations; Divination, which is focused on reading current and past events through the weave; necromancy, the study of curses and singular magic, of undeath, and spirit; biomancy, the study of biology and its interactions with magic, and edicts that affect it, such as healing spells; charms, which influence the mind; enchantments, edicts that do not decay easily, able to remain for a long time. 

### Types of Spells
Contingencies. With the right magic, you can create an edict that is frozen, ready to be released, and another edict whose purpose is to release the first one. These are called contingency setups. They can contain complicated logic setups and twines.

Layered spells, where you merge two edicts onto one. This can have strange and unpredictable effects. 

Constructs, which are complicated spells whose edict contains so much intent, instruction, and folds, which are used to perform computations. Simple ones do not even need to interact with the weave. The quidditiy fed to the edict will naturally compute the result. More complicated ones can affect with the world, constructing "Proper Constructs". Very difficult ones can host soulbonds, called Telos Constructs.

Alchemy, edicts which are developed to recognise and understand chemical and fold structures, which covers transmutation and transference of magical energy. There are many mixtures and chemicals that exist. Everything from medicine to acid. Potions refer to a subset of these mixtures, which require additionally a transfer of magical energy. Spells used in material science and chemistry and transmutation are typically of an Alchemic edict. Sing divine magic to move electrons around, allowing for synthesis and manipulation of molecules at a level we can never hope to master.

Artifice, which covers edicts that are meant to handle material-quiddic interactions.

Healing Edicts, which use self-image, and biology, to reform the body. Having interesting effects. Healing spells heal based on Intent. Your self-perception. So if you lose your arm, but you think of yourself as a person who usually has two arms, it grows back with enough magic. But if you think of yourself as a one-handed person, it won't. A depressed person tends to be immune to healing spells. It's not quite 'reshaping' yourself. Your biology and DNA also affect healing spells. It also means healing can leave behind no scars if the person isn't scarred in their mind, but if a wound represents a great failure, that scar may never leave. A particularly resilient person with a lot of magic at their disposal may continue to see themselves as young, constantly healing and retaining their youth. Polymorph is a stronger version of this that ignores your biology. Developed over time. Depending on visualisation and intent. Allowing you to reshape even your DNA, developed based on some natural phenomena involving Dragonborn. But it's usually temporary as your DNA is memorised by your soul. It takes stronger magic to make it permanent.

### Location
The structure of the topology gives us the planes. Different local structures and topologies affect the way magic seems to work. For example around portals, which affect the minimum local dimensionality and makes thus the surfaces shown by Gauss's law to be a lot larger than they are meant to be.
