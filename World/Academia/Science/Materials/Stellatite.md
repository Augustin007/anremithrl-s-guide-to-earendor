Stellatite is a non-decaying reservoir material and non-corrodible conduit of quiddity.

Stellatite is a crystalline material. It has a look similar to quartz and other clear feldspathic crystals. But unlike most natural crystals it demonstrates a global coherence. And unlike the insulative quartz, stellatite is a room temperature superconductor of electricity. 

It is classed neither as a conventional mineral nor as keyed matter in the usual sense. Its resistance to chemical and magical decomposition places it among the ACSs (anomalous crystalline substrates), alongside substances such as Zhanite, though their axonic affinities differ significantly. 

It exibits a hyper-global crystalinity, its lattice coherence appears uninterrupted across the entire contiguous crystal mass, even when fractured or partially damaged. Things remain in line even when separated by small amounts. Over a critical distance, depending on the mass of stellatite, it finally untangles. The forces that cause are what give it its Piezoaxonic effect, as a consequence of how it rearranges its particles to maintain its properties.

Its Piezoaxonic, where under stress releases a small amount of charge along the Entropic Axon, creating a Choas-Order quiddic differential across itself, which mantains its hyper-global crystalinity. This makes Stellatite_dangerous to work with. Improper cutting or mining can result in localized entropic cascades, spontaneous freezing, temporal shear, or chaotic flare-events depending on ambient conditions. 

Stellatite can hold magical energy indefinitely without decay. Most conductive materials (gold, silver, obsidian) act as temporary reservoirs and eventually burn out as quiddity leaks back into the weave. Stellatite does not. These allow it to be used for arcane batteries, spell anchors, and quiddic capacitors. 

It has no known way to synthesise, and chemical analysis has not been able to determine what atoms it is made of, as attempting magical chemical analysis on it tends to just absorb the magic. It forms in areas of high magical density, and requiring large amounts of pressure, needing to be miles under mountains, which means it is only found near the Tree of Sanctuary in the impassible mountains, and near the Rift in the Shattered Region.
