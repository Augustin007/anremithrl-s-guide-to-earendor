A Telos Construct is an advanced form of magical creation involving the integration of an animus into its structure. The process involves fusing artifice and necromancy. 

Telos Constructs can act as sentient companions or protectors, possessing a degree of consciousness and autonomy. Many of these take on souls of animals which are then enhanced with magical intelligence. Their adaptability make them valuable assets. 

The magic is rare and difficult to do.

Sometimes it has been used on human souls, often to preserve them.

### Baeor's Resurrection
In 845, Sebastian Valerius conducted a difficult temporary resurrection spell on the soul of Baeor, allowing him to return to his physical body for a limited time. However, after the trial, Lucy and Richard managed to save his escaping soul using a ritual that binds it to a Telos Construct created by Richard with the assistance of The Raven Queen. This allowed them to resurrect their friend and retain his memories and personality, despite his physical body being gone.
