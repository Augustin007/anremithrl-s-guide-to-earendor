A calendar compiling all notes with an explicit date given. Not intended to tell the complete story, but rather as a reference for how things intertwine. The real calendar beginning from 1st of Flamerule, 5420 AS, as events from before aren't covered.

People who have been involved in these machinations for a while. Many people reprising roles from previous campaigns.

He is also told to find out what happened at the Tree of Names and the Prison of the Betrayers three years ago, since no one really knows what happened even now, only that whatever happened was part of the late King Idros of Thundrak's plan to defeat Auril, and that the king of the Dragonborn countries, King Valthor Draco-Remshi's son and heir the Prince Nil'ge'tar "Nugget" Remshi died at that battle, because days later his brother Tar'id'lion'nil "Tarnil" Remshi was named heir.
King Aukun explains that they cannot hope to defend against Auril forever, so they must eventually strike an offensive. Since Gallio is already going south, he should act as an ambassador for Aukun, establishing the NAF - Northern Alliance of Foédus, an initiative spearheaded by King Bressus Stonefist, king of Durinul, a bordering country to Solenthir, where Aukun rules.

He can gain a monopoly in that region.

Shipments that are not his have to be taxed more heavily when going through Golin. He speaks to Galio about a similar deal with Solenthir, but Galio cannot make such a deal on his King Aukun's behalf, and besides, nothing _can get_ to Solenthir, at the moment. It is too far north, and the open Deathwood pass is in the dragonborn territories, and the Aldarkeep pass has long been held by Auril.
William lets slip that he knows more about Auril than others, because he was at the Tree of Names three years before, and curiosity piqued, he tells them that Colossus was there too, and that they were on a mission for King Idros, whose kingdom fell to Auril and who is no more. They confirm he is telling the truth with a Zone of Truth cast by Noab's Sorcerer Airon Boodwine of Azerim.

LADY BLACK
---
From 1st Hammer-27th Hammer
Lady Black begins her descent into the nine hells. She arrives at Dis, the outermost layer. She takes a strange creature from here as a guide, who offers her water. She sees them having fun, torturing dead souls here for all eternity.
Lady Black manages to convince the demons that surround her to take her to Archduke Dispater. She is terrified as his aura overpowers her. He shows her visions of the vast forces on his side. She finds herself agreeing that good will lose. That there is no hope. Once she escapes, though, she recollects her wits and talks to the people. 
She sings and dances and tells them the story of a little boy who becomes a tyrant, and how he leads his people in a war and into ruin for his own gain. How a traveler passed by who could have helped the people rise up against him, and how many did not follow because they were afraid, and there was no rebellion, and she says that it would have been better to have fallen in rebellion than to have lived in this state.
She gives a speech, and chanting "Kill the Boy", the crowd marches onto the Archduke's land. She runs and hides, as she hadn't meant this to happen, but the Archduke comes out and kills them all, a few escape, a few stand a little longer, but none for long and it begins to rain blood heavily. She nearly drowns in the blood, but escapes into the next level.
Lady Black bargains with Isendra, and convinces her to turn on the other heads with the help of the Traveller. In return Lady Black gets a vision of a possible future. 
She sees snapshots of other things. Hints of something more ancient than Tartarus.

He travels until he reaches the edge of the plane.
Travelling to the edge of the plane.
He uses some of the rifts to skip the Caverns of Stillness and leap straight into the Floating Mountains. 
Here he meets the boucaneer Abdul, who talks to him a bit about the floating mountains and whatnot. William tries to use smoke signals and stuff to get a response.
He gives in to Tahlia, who needs him to look at a door. He uses her scroll to teleport him just past the edges of Westhaven (using Asmodeus to provide an exception to Auril's antiteleport, but not daring to mess with Tal'berius's). She shows him the door to a dungeon, but he refuses to open it for her, instead shooting an arrow of explosion at it. The door retaliates, and William is knocked out. The alarms start ringing. Tahlia draws blood from William and heals him. He tries to knock the vial out of his hand as she pushes him out of the area and teleports him to his 'home', as per the warning.
