The establishment of the Modern International Calendar (Sometimes called the Sundering Year Calendar) by Neros in the year 4600 AS, and its later adoption nearly worldwide created as a byproduct a system of ten-day weeks, (Freeday, Solday, Lysday, Wyrday, Solday, Celday, Earday, Elessday, Marday, Taisday, Primday), where five weeks of the year have an eleventh day.

This is always reserved for the last day of 31-day months. Over the years a series of traditions has grown up around it.

**Core Traditions:**

Oven Batches: Eleven rolls baked; the eleventh gifted away. In dwarven cities, this extends to forges — every eleventh ingot must be given freely, often to apprentices or widows.

Harvest Tithes: Every 11th bushel, sheaf, or barrel goes to the poor. 

Day of Rest: Schools, courts, and most guildhalls close. It is shameful to labor openly — only healers and guards are exempt.

**Foedic and Velorian Customs**

Betrothal Day: Elevensies weddings are said to bind eleven generations. In Veloria, the Senate keeps official wedding rolls marked only on Elevensies.

Sweet-Giving: People make sweet-dough “elevenses rolls”, These are knotted into shapes of eleven, and given out for free. In some regions where the calendar is less adopted, or tourist regions, these same rolls are sold at exorbitant prices to visitors. 

**Debt Day**
In Sholara and much of Sunktopeth, debts must be cleared before Elevensies or they are doubled. This is tied to desert-trader ethics — no journey should be burdened by lingering obligation.

**Spice-lotteries**
In Destrog and Garakhel, public feasts include spice raffles where every eleventh ticket wins a prize.

**Swanward**
Hopscotch grids of 1–11; stepping on “ten” owes your mother a chore, stepping on “eleven” means fortune.

**Zarethys**
Eleven lanterns are set afloat on rivers or lakes, honoring lost ancestors. The eleventh is always made to drift further, symbolizing the unknown.

**Stormbelt**
Every eleventh log in a bonfire is carved with a rune and burned for protection against chaos. Kesna records its histories with eleven-line stanzas read aloud each Elevensies

People in Hatreth see it as a sort of interesting foreign custom, though they do not understand it. They mock the high prices of the sweets, not knowing it's free for locals, but for all their mocking they buy it anyways. Some merchants in Kesna keep track of when people on the MIY system have elevensies and use it in their marketing and sales, and many Kesnans who see it as a popular exotic Velorian tradition buy 'elevensies' related goods and even do mini-celebrations.

In Leq'er they see it as unnecessary, even decadent. Their ancestral cycles take precedence. However, traders do sometimes humor it abroad to fit in with Velorian partners.

The Draumer of Bharam do not celebrate elevensies, though they use the MIY. 

The Ha'dii cults in Sunktopeth pointedly ignore it.

Intercultural interactions affect this as well. Some merchants _expect_ debt-clearing on elevensies, particularly if they are from Sholara and Sunktopeth. Days where Foedic or Velorians may allow a wedding day sometimes do not coincide with similar days in Hatreth for years, forcing more traditional couples to wait until they coincide. Cultures that do not celebrate it are frustrated when working with people from cultures that do, as on that day they are still working and others are 'being idle', Elevensies is often used in Leq'er as an example of foreign idleness and their superiority.
