Isfet, the Queen of Chaos, is one of the most powerful entities in [[Eärendor]]. She is equivalent to the realm of [[Pandemonium]], the realm of chaos and unpredictability. 

[[The Tides of Chaos]] are heavily infused with her will.

She is the sole source of Chaotic Quiddity.

She is bonded to [[Ao]], and loves him.

She at some point she gained the servitude of [[Faust]], who causes havoc in her name, though she is mostly indifferent to such ordinary havoc.[^1]
