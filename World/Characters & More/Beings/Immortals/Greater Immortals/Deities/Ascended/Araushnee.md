Araushnee was an elven queen born in the Age of Rising with great knowledge of the Arcane. She was betrothed to [[Glorfindel]], but she eloped with [[Tyr]] on the day she turned a century old. This very nearly caused a war. 

Araushnee devoted much of her time to studying lore and magic, and her circle of wizards was quite proficient.

Fifty years before the Sundered War, she and her circle were able to perform a series of tests on [[Elandra]], and successfully created spells to capture Celestials.

She was said to be infertile, and when she eventually concieved it was considered a miracle. A year before the end of the war, she had a son, Janhaire, who was born ill, and died a few days later. 

This spurred the creation of the Unbinding Edict, with which she UnNamed [[The Forgotten One|Mortis]] and took his place, becoming the Raven Queen.

The reprecussions of this caused the Sundered War.

After the Sundered War, she did not feel welcome on [[Arvandor]], though her husband Tyr did. Instead she took the [[Shadowfell]], a leftover of a strange creation of [[Vecna]]'s, and reconstructed aspects of the Astral Plane there, and became known as the goddess of dying and the goddess of memories.

She was unable to provide resurrections until a deal with [[Marethyu]]. This was too late to bring back her son.

She took [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] as a champion and allowed him to resurrect [[Baeor Dechaius]], despite a cost to herself.[^1]

She took [[Colossus Methunroa|Colossus]] as a champion and aided him. She sent him often ravens bearing messages.[^2]

She lost her divinity when Vecna returned to the Shadowfell and opened it to [[the Dark Regions]], due to how much of herself she had put into it. She slowly began dying along with the plane until Colossus offered to switch his championship to Marethyu in exchange for her life. She was able to then aid Colossus in reclaiming the Shadowfell and killing Vecna.[^3]
