# The Raven Queen: A Lore Document

## Introduction

The Raven Queen is a deity of immense complexity, embodying themes of memory, sorrow, and redemption. Once an Elven Queen named Araushnee, she ascended to godhood through a series of tragic and tumultuous events. This document aims to explore the multi-faceted nature of the Raven Queen, her rise to power, her fall from grace, and her role in the cosmic order following the Sundered War.

## Early Life as Araushnee

Araushnee was the Elven Queen of a realm deeply connected to the arcane arts. She was a beacon of grace and wisdom, leading her people with a compassionate hand. Her life took a tragic turn when her son was claimed by death, an event that shattered her emotionally and mentally.

## Ascension to Godhood

Consumed by grief and anger, Araushnee led her people in the study of forbidden magics. She aimed to challenge the gods themselves, particularly the god of death, to bring back her son. Her audacity led her to [[Arvandor]], the realm of gods, where she usurped the god of death and took his powers for herself. Thus, Araushnee became a god, but at a terrible cost.

## The Sundered War

The Raven Queen played a pivotal role in the Sundered War, a cosmic conflict that nearly led to the annihilation of the mortal realm. Initially, she was a prisoner in the Nine Hells, subjected to unimaginable tortures. However, her liberation by the mortal Tyr turned the tide of the war, leading to the eventual victory of the Protector gods.

## The Palace of Memories

In her self-imposed exile, the Raven Queen resides in the Palace of Memories, a demiplane within the Shadowfell. This palace serves as a sanctuary for memories and stories, which she hoards obsessively. It is a place of sorrow but also of preservation, a testament to her complex nature.

## Divine Portfolio

- **Memory**: The Raven Queen is the guardian of all memories, preserving them in her Palace of Memories.
  
- **Sorrow**: She embodies the sorrow that comes from loss, a feeling she knows all too well.
  
- **Redemption**: After her role in the Sundered War, she also represents the possibility of redemption, even for a god.

## Worship and Followers

The Raven Queen has a small but devoted following. Her worshippers often include those who have suffered great losses and seek solace or redemption. They offer prayers and rituals to honor memories and the departed.

## Cosmic Role Post-Sundered War

After the Sundered War, the Raven Queen's realm became one of the final resting places for souls, alongside the Seven Heavens and the Nine Hells. She serves as a guardian of these souls, ensuring they find peace or face judgment based on their life's deeds.

## Conclusion

The Raven Queen is a deity of many layers, embodying the complexities of emotion, the weight of memories, and the possibility of redemption. Her story is one of tragedy, audacity, and ultimately, resilience. She remains a significant figure in the cosmic order, a god who has tasted both the bitterness of loss and the sweetness of redemption.
