Hechilspet was a king who ruled the Chish empire for some time. He was born of [[Iskandar|King Iskandar the Wise]] and [[Isa|Queen Isa]]. 

Isa died at childbirth, and his father, a noble man, helped unite the people of the region, and sacrified himself to save his realm, leaving the prince Hechilspet an orphan at twelve years old.

Hechilspet was never denied what he wished. He was very cunning, like his father, but unlike Iskandar he was self-serving.

He became a warlord, and expanded the empire to where it is known today. He took many items of great power from many people, including one of the [[Silanderi]] and even the [[Flameheart]]. 

He sought greatly the [[Tome of Silence]] of his father, but he could never find it.

He met [[Lysaria]] and was enamoured by her beauty, and lied to her that [[Eolande|her lover]] had died in the nine hells, hoping to marry her. She refused, and he imprisoned her. She rejected him many more times before his escape.

Though he had his share of mistresses, he never married, and spoke only bitterly of Lysaria. She was the only one to ever defy him to his face before his defeat, and live to tell the tale. Of all the things he had ever demanded, she was the only one he could not get. Lysaria's rejection is often theorised to have spurred his genocidal policies during his Iron Reign.

As his rule expanded, he became more ambitious and avaricious. He was widely considered a tyrant, particularly after the beginning of the Iron Reign, and his genocide of non-humans

He allowed any who wished to challenge him in single combat, and it was considered a sacred right to the people of the empire, and many lined up to fight him each day, but he struck down each and every person who opposed him in single combat.

He enjoyed pain in others, and often watched torture occuring. He occasionally subjected his own self to torture, publically, with the intention of making himself stronger.

He pioneered divination and farsight, and had a group of enforcers known as the Bloodied Hand. He thus knew all that occurred in his lands, and crime was nearly eradicated under his rule. There are sects of people who prospered under his rule, and even the common people recognised the severe reduction in crime, and thus there were some who turned a blind eye to his bloodlust and atrocities and claimed times were better under this tyrant. 

As he got older, and his body began to weaken, he began to fear death, and began searching for ways to prolong his life indefinitely. He sacrificed many slaves and siphoned their lives to increase in power, and began demanding worship of his people, until he ascended into godhood.

His acts of evil did not decrease as time pass, but rather increased. When he ascended he became more violent, impulsive, and mad. He needed greater punishments, more executions, more strange and unusual torture to satiate his bloodlust, and he became known as the god of pain. Soon many feared him, and all called him mad. 

[[Eleutheros]] spoke often and boldly against him. 

Eventually Hechilspet decided to track  down personally, as he in his pride did not believe he could be defeated. It is not known how, but Eleutheros managed to lock him away in a [[Hechilspet's Prison|prison]] fit for a god, modeled after [[the Nine Hells]]. This was the year 3343.


He somehow relayed messages to Tormac and Asmodeus from his prison, and the Greenclad worked to try to free him for some time, nearly succeeding.[^1] He also tricked [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] into making a deal with him.


The Ha'dii were a terrorist cult devoted to him and his policies. Many centuries after the Greenclad's attempt, they succeeded in freeing him from his prison.[^2]. He terrorized sections of Foedus until his defeat in single combat against [[Galio Thunukalathi]].[^3]
