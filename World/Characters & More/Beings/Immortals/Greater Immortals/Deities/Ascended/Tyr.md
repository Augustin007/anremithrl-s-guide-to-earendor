Tyr was the husband of [[Araushnee]]. During the Sundering War, because of his lesser status, could slip into the nine hells and evade the alarms and defenses that guarded the Raven Queen's prison. He unlocked her chains, and as they fell away, her power surged back, restoring her to the might she had wielded when she had slain the god of death. And he died soon thereafter, and the Raven Queen caught his soul as it fled, and in an act she could never replicate thereafter, she turned him into a god.

And the gods, needing help, accepted the Raven Queen and Tyr as allies.

The Protector gods, still exiled from Arvandor and locked out by the unyielding council, found a new home. They crafted [[The Seven Heavens]] in the quasi-plane situated between the Material Plane and the distant [[Elysium]]. In these celestial realms, they dwelt, forever separated from their original divine abode, and they called themselves the [[Righteous Council]]. Tyr joined them there, and they accepted him as one of their own.

He lived in the [[Shadowfell]] along with his wife.

He approved of her choice of [[Colossus Methunroa|Colossus]] as a champion.[^1]

He lost his powers when she did, as she was the source of them.[^2]

He dies during [[The Shattering]].
