Acheron was known for having little emotion or impulse, and seeming incapable of understanding certain things. He has a certain detachment from the world many find disturbing. He has no natural aversion towards violence or attraction towards beauty. He does not find violence beautiful either, but is rather indifferent towards it. He is a brilliant architect and created many of the weapons of the gods. He gets along well with many of the Elohim due to his lack of aversion to violence. 

Acheron was the principal architect of [[The Nine Hells]], and named one of the layers after himself. He created great beasts such as Balrogs and Hellhounds during [[The Sundering War]]. His spells are on most weapons of the betrayers and their allies.

Though he aided the Betrayer Gods, he did not consider himself one of them. He was still locked up in [[The Nine Hells]] along with them. He does not much care. He often does favours for [[Asmodeus]], who rules the Betrayer Gods, but just as easily refuses them. He often asks favours of Asmodeus in return, who often complies out of friendship.

He sent a group of Hellhounds after [[Nil'ge'tar Remshi'ul|Nil'ge'tar]] at [[Asmodeus]]'s request. He conferred with the party for some time before allowing them free.[^1]
