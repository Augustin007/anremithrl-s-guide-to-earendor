Nebelum had a brother named [[Gond]]. 

Nebelum loves knowledge. and often gave his followers photographic memory. He preferred to not be caught up in the going-ons and instead learn more about the universe. 

He was the ruler of the Eldorath people.

He appeared in visions to [[Theriad Keladri|Theriad]] and Theriad eventually became his Champion[^1].

He had Theriad aid him in the building of an enormous library demiplane named Lorekeep for the world to access and learn from and add to, a repository of all knowledge.[^2]
