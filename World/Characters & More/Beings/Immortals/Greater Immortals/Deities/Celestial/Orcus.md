He created the Orcs and Goblins along with [[Ares]].

He was one of the followers of [[Tharizdun]] and took leadership after [[Tharizdun]]'s capture. His complete and disastrous failure of an assault likely cost them the war, and resulted in him bowing to [[Asmodeus]]'s will. 

He is often conflated with Vecna in stories and myths and it can be unclear which is which.

The necromancer Korvus the Deathcaller later claimed to be his prophet.[^1][^2][^3]
