Thalorin had a great devotion to compassion and mercy and was a close friend of [[Erebus]]. 

Thalorin became the leader of the Halls of Order with the support of [[Asmodeus]], and the two became great friends over their ideals of justice, though Asmodeus disdained the fact that Thalorin insisted on mercy being more important than justice. 

When [[Araushnee]] slew and UnNamed [[The Forgotten One]], Thalorin alone wept for the mortals who would bear the cost. He spoke before the Council that vengeance untempered by mercy would breed only more rebellion. 

When Asmodeus took the Raven Queen to the Nine Hells, Tharizdun pleaded with the council to spare her, not because he wished her any good, but out of principle. And when the council voted on whether mortals should be unmade, Thalorin stood first and foremost against it.

He and his two siblings [[Elandra]] and [[Varian]] broke away from the council and became known as the Triad of Protectors, and later founded the [[Righteous Council]], and branded [[Asmodeus]] and his people the [[Betrayer Gods]].

He eventually made a deal with [[Marethyu]] to remain asleep and never wake up in order that there be peace between the gods and the mortals be protected. Marethyu was not potent enough to fully provide that, but he did what he could, and Thalorin did not wake up until the peace was over.

He had an order of followers devoted to keeping this peace.[^1]

When he woke up, his clerics and followers were burned up by the sudden influx of power. [^1][^2]
