Erebus, the Shadow, was one of the original twenty Celestials created by the combined efforts of [[Atropus]], [[Kossuth]], [[Akadi]], and [[Istishia]] to counter [[Dur-baagal]]'s Elohim. Unlike many of his fellow Celestials, Erebus was a solitary figure, preferring the quietude of the shadows to the clamor of the Celestial Council. Erebus sacrificed himself during the battle against the [[Epic Dragons]], his shadowy form dissipating into the cosmic winds.
