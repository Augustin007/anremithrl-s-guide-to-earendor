In the annals of the Celestial Council, few figures are as enigmatic and yet as influential as [[Thalassa]]. Like all Celestials she was born from the collective will of [[Atropus]], [[Istishia]], [[Kossuth]], and [[Akadi]]. Thalassa was a being of immense power, her essence intertwined with the very fabric of the elemental waters. She was the favorite of [[Istishia]], the Elemental Sibling of Water, and her dominion extended to the depths of the oceans and the vastness of the seas.

She was one of the eight Celestials who fell before the indomitable might of the Dragons.
