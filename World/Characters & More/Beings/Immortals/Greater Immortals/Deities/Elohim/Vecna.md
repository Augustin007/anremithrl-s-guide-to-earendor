Vecna was a god. He was split into pieces by various beings during the Sundered War, formost of them was his own leuitenant [[Kas]], who betrayed them. Each piece was hidden in different dungeons, and they vowed never to allow them to be unified.

He was bound into a physical body by Araushnee's spell.

The god [[Vecna]] was split into pieces by [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]], [[Elu Singollo]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Elian]], [[Araushnee]], [[Vistani]], [[Artorius]], and Vecna's own leuitennant [[Kas]].  Each hid their piece in a different dungeon of their own creation, promising never to unify them.

The Dracolich of Karr is one of the most feared creatures in the underdark and was created by Artorius as a guardian for the left hand. It is said that those who cross its path are doomed to suffer a terrible fate.

In order to rebind Chaos Crack, Talberius travelled far and obtained Vecna's left hand and replaced it with the missing one, which gave him greater power over Chaos.

[[Vecna]]'s heart, hidden by [[Kas]], is guarded by Ashdilkir deep under [[Bremen]].

[[Tahlia Tormund]] obtained Vecna's eye from deep under [[Westhaven]].
