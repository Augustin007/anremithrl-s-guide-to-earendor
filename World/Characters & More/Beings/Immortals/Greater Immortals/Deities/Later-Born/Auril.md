Auril was a born of [[Rhea]] and [[Asmodeus]].

During the eternal wars, she became good friends with [[Tartarus]], and impressed him by defeating [[Dur-baagal]] in single combat, stealing his powers.

She hated her half-sister [[Tiamat]].

She followed her uncle [[Tharizdun]] during [[The Sundering War]], but after his capture did not follow [[Orcus]], but rather returned to her father.

She tricked Tiamat and escaped [[The Nine Hells]] when [[Valthor Remshi]] attempted to break out Tiamat.[^1] She then shifted the planet and began an eternal winter in the North and an eternal sunshine in the north, causing enormous variations in the sea for a few years as the southern caps melted and the northern caps froze. The final result actually lowered the sea level by a few centimeters.

She ravaged the north and caused a great war between the various countries, while amassing her own forces in the [[Frostmourne]]. She maintained a close circle of clerics known as the [[Sons of Auril]][^2][^3][^4], and enforcers known as the [[Silven Crown]].[^3][^4]

She invaded and destroyed Thundrak and killed [[Id'ros Aka-Illion]] [^2]

She personally dealt with the Chyrohydra [[William Treaty]] unleashed.[^3]

She attempted to use [[Torquil Leogan]] to gain the knowledge of the Unbinding ritual, though it failed[^4] . She did successfully capture [[Liriel Danstal]] and the [[Codex of Abraham the Mage]], and use them for her own purposes[^4].

[[Krag]] attempted and failed to kill her in the [[Frostmourne]].[^3]

She was eventually killed during [[The Shattering]], as Liriel turned on her when Auril was temporarily stripped of her divinity and tried using [[Aric Vael]] as a battery. Liriel killed and thus UnNamed Auril and stole her power.[^3].
