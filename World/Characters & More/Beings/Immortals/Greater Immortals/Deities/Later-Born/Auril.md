**Titles:** The Frostmaiden, The Crying Sky, The Last Winter, The Queen of Silence, The Pale Sister of Asmodeus

Auril was not born as a god of cold, nor of cruelty.  
In the first ages she was the **goddess of the changing seasons**, a lesser daughter of Akadi — the Windmother — and one of the youngest to join the Celestial Council. She was radiant and gentle, a goddess of renewal, frost, and thaw alike, the herald of endings that promised rebirth.

Yet even then, her nature was misunderstood. Mortals feared the bite of her winters more than they blessed the beauty of her snow. Their prayers turned to Akadi for warmth and flight, and to Hekate for storm and lightning, leaving Auril alone — worshipped only when the land was dying.  
Her bitterness took root in silence.

### The Fracture of Heart and Season

When Araushnee (later the Raven Queen) murdered the God of Death, the cosmic balance shifted, and Auril’s domain of natural death and renewal was torn asunder. What should have been cyclical — frost followed by spring — became **eternal winter** within her heart.

As Asmodeus and Tharizdun rose in fury, Auril aligned herself with them not from conviction, but from despair. She argued that mortals had betrayed the natural order by clinging to life beyond their season — that the end should come, cold and pure. Where Asmodeus saw law and Tharizdun saw annihilation, Auril saw _cleansing._

Her words were frost to the council:

> “You pity mortals for their suffering. I envy them for its brevity.”

She joined the Betrayer Gods at the dawn of the Sundering War, her armies of frost-born celestials and frozen titans sweeping through mortal kingdoms. Her winds extinguished the cities of Thalassos and drowned the Anami in ice. Her power grew not through faith, but through fear — every soul that died frozen became a mirror for her loneliness.

---

### The Final Storm

As the war reached its end, and the Betrayers were driven back, Auril unleashed her greatest storm — a final act of destruction to scar the world. It swept across the Devaali lands, and in its path died a girl named **Ashdilkir**, who gave her life to save her people.

That storm would become her curse. For even as the gods sealed the Betrayers in the Nine Hells, the act of such unrestrained divinity fractured Auril’s essence. Her domain collapsed inward — she became incapable of warmth, incapable of thaw. The seasons ceased to turn within her.  
She was sealed in the Hells beside Asmodeus and Tharizdun, though even they feared her silence.

### The Ice Between Gods

For thousands of years, Auril slept beneath the frozen spires of Nessus, dreaming of a world locked in stillness. Her tears became shards of ice that Asmodeus used to bind souls, each shard reflecting fragments of her divine mind. When Asmodeus rose to power as Lord of Law, he used her grief as fuel — her frost lent weight to his words.

Yet even he could not command her. She spoke rarely, but when she did, her words stilled whole courts:

> “You think yourself eternal, brother. I have watched eternity freeze.”

When the Sundering’s echoes faded and the mortal world began to heal, Auril’s essence stirred again. She found in mortals a reflection of her own suffering — their fear, their longing for control — and twisted it into worship. Those who prayed for endurance in the cold found her hand upon them, blessing them with strength and indifference alike.

Her first mortal cults — the Frostwrought, the Winter’s Choir, and the Crying Sky — arose in northern Foedus, where her storms never ceased. There she was not hated. She was _believed in._

---

### The Long Cold

During the **Age of Shadows**, as Shar sought to free Tartarus, Auril’s influence crept across the world like frost through glass. She created the _Frostforged Legions_ — spirits of the dead encased in eternal ice — and whispered to mortals in their dreams, promising peace in stillness, order in death.

By the **Age of Heroes**, her worship had dwindled to sects and whispers, but her power remained. She saw in mortals’ new mastery of magic a new kind of fire — one that must, inevitably, be smothered.

And so, when the mortal age reached its zenith, Auril returned in full.  
Her descent heralded the **Age of Harmony’s unraveling**.

The northern world froze. Dakrenthorne fell beneath endless snow. The Tree of Names trembled beneath her storms. She returned not as goddess of renewal, but as avatar of _despair perfected._

---

### The Last War

Her final campaign began as vengeance — against gods who had forgotten her, against mortals who had outlived their rightful winters. She allied with Bechel of Bharam and struck down the Dragonborn realms, destroying Thundrak and slaying King Idros of Foedus. She sought to extinguish the Tree of Names, believing that only by ending the cycle of souls could she end the pain of life itself.

For years, her presence blotted the sun. Her followers — the Sons of Auril — brought winter to cities long untouched by frost. The Alliance of the North collapsed under her storms. Yet in the end, her vengeance turned hollow.

When the Shattering came, her forces were drawn to the Tree, where gods and mortals met in final reckoning. There, she faced **Liriel Vael**, bearing the _Codex of Abraham the Mage_, and **Aric Vael**, whom she sought to use as vessel for her return to divinity.

Liriel turned the Codex upon her.  
Auril’s divinity was unbound, consumed by Colossus Methunroa’s Divine Unbinding spell, and she was slain — but not ended. Her death froze the battlefield for three days. The frost did not melt even after her body was gone.

---

### The Frozen Legacy

Auril’s essence is not dead — merely dormant. The mortals say that each flake of snow that lands without melting carries a memory of her silence. Her divine shard, _The Shard of Stillness_, lies buried beneath the ruins of the Tree, pulsing faintly with cold light.

Her faith, though outlawed, persists in northern Foedus and among the shattered cults of Bharam. They say that in the endless night, her voice still whispers:

> “The warm forget. The cold remember.”

To some, she is a monster — to others, a martyr.  
To herself, she was never either.  
She was the last goddess to feel sorrow for the world.

Would you like me to append an **Age-by-Age chronology** for her — mapping where she appears across each era (Gods → Sundering → Wandering → Shadows → Heroes → Harmony → Shattering)?  
That version would mirror your campaign-history indexing format and interlink her timeline with Asmodeus, Ashariel, and Tartarus for cross-reference.
