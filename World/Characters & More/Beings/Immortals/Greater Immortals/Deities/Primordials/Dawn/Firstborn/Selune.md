## Introduction

Selune, is a primordial entity that exists beyond the confines of the [[Eärendor|Universe]]. Unlike her sister [[Shar]], who whispers dark secrets and sows discord, Selune offers sanctuary from the chaos and conflicts that have plagued the Dawn, Dusk, and their offspring. She dwells in [[Elysium]].

## Origin

Selune is one of the Firstborn, conceived from the primordial energies of [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]]. Her existence predates the formation of the Universe, and she the twin sister of Shar. While Shar embodies the darker aspects of existence, Selune represents the light, offering a haven for those who seek respite from the Eternal Wars and other cosmic conflicts.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

During the tumultuous period known as the Eternal Wars, Selune remained neutral. She did not participate in the battles that raged across the planes but instead offered sanctuary to those who wished to abandon the conflict. Telos and Nehusta, found refuge with Selune after fleeing from the Universe to escape the unending strife.

## Sanctuary Beyond the Universe

Selune's realm exists beyond the Universe, a place untouched by the conflicts that have marred the Dawn and Dusk. Elysium is a sanctuary where beings can find peace and solace, away from the machinations of Shar and the destructive tendencies of the Primordials. Those who enter Selune's sanctuary are bound by a cosmic truce, forbidden from engaging in hostilities while within her domain. Telos and Nehusta dwell there, building beautiful things pleasing to Selune.

## Influence on Cosmic Entities

While Selune does not actively participate in the cosmic conflicts, her influence is felt throughout the Universe. Her sanctuary serves as a diplomatic ground where beings can negotiate without fear of betrayal. It is said that many of the temporary ceasefires during the Eternal Wars were brokered in Selune's realm, although these truces often proved short-lived once the parties returned to the Universe.

## Conclusion

Selune stands as a beacon of hope and sanctuary in a universe torn by conflict and betrayal. While she may not wield her power in the battles that shape the cosmos, her influence is a calming force that offers a brief respite from the chaos. As the Eternal Wars continue to rage, Selune's sanctuary remains a place where weary souls can find a moment's peace.
