## Introduction

Arambar, commonly known as the Titan, is one of the Cosmic Twins and a Primordial entity of immense power and wisdom. He is the quieter and more contemplative counterpart to his twin, [[Asgorath|Asgorath the World-Shaper]]. This document aims to explore the life, abilities, and contributions of Arambar, with a particular focus on his role in the creation of the [[Eärendor|Universe]] and the Eternal Wars.

## Origin and Nature

Arambar is a Primordial being, a child of the abstract entities [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]]. He shares this lineage with his twin, Asgorath. Unlike his more impulsive and visionary twin, Arambar is characterized by his quiet contemplation, endless patience, and deliberate actions. His essence is a complex blend of both Chaos and Order, making him a being of great power and depth.

## Creation of the Universe

Arambar played a crucial role in the creation of the Universe, a vision initially conceived by his twin, Asgorath. Together, they created Time and Aether, weaving these elements into the Universe's fabric. The Cosmic Twins offered to create a plane for each member of their family within this new Universe. While their parents, Chaos and Order, remained distant, and their elder siblings, [[Selune]] and [[Shar]], opted to stay in almost-time, Arambar and Asgorath proceeded to create the True Planes. They crafted a unique Plane for each of their Elemental siblings and established the [[Ethereal Plane]] for themselves—a realm intricately connected to all other planes in the Universe.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Arambar was a significant figure in the Eternal Wars, a cosmic conflict involving gods, Primordials, and other celestial entities. Initially outnumbered, he and Asgorath retreated to strategize. Arambar's patience and wisdom were invaluable during this period, as he considered the long-term implications of their actions.

## The Final Act

In a pivotal moment during the Eternal Wars, Arambar chose to lead [[Atropus]]'s Celestials on a final chase to protect his twin and their [[Epic Dragons|secret works]]. Captured and facing his end, Arambar unleashed a powerful work as his final act of defiance. He granted every god—be it Elessar, Elohim, or Celestial—their own free will. This calculated act led to a rebellion against their creators, changing the course of the war.

## Legacy

Arambar's legacy is one of wisdom, sacrifice, and profound impact. His role in the creation of the Universe and his final act during the Eternal Wars have left an indelible mark on the cosmic landscape. Though he met his end, his influence continues to resonate throughout the cosmos.

## Conclusion

Arambar, the Titan, is a being of immense power and wisdom. His contributions to the creation of the Universe and his actions during the Eternal Wars have had far-reaching consequences. His final act of granting free will to the gods serves as a testament to his foresight and understanding of the complexities of cosmic power dynamics.
