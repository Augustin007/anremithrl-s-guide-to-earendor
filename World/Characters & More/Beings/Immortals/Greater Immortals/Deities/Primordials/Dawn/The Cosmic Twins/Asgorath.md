Asgorath is the twin of [[Arambar]]. 

Asgorath first concieved the ideas of the Universe and of physics, he is thus known as the Worldshaper. He was less patient than his brother Arambar.

The twins created the universe after Asgorath's plans and offered each of their siblings true planes of their own and established the [[Ethereal Plane]] for themselves—a realm connected to all the other planes in the universe.

Asgorath impulsively killed [[Ubtao]] when he learned of the deception.

When [[Atropus]] turned the Celestials on the other primordials, Arambar and Asgorath worked on a [[Epic Dragons|secret project]] to defeat the Atropus. When it was nearly completed it was discovered, and they unleashed the [[Eater of Dawn]] upon the Celestials. The three stood for some time against the Celestials, but they began to lose, and the Eater of Dawn was defeated. Arambar chose to lead the Celestials on a final chase away from his brother, which led to his death at their hands.

Incensed, Asgorath recreated the work, knowing more, though with lesser potency without his twin, to kill the Celestials as vengeance. He created four more, which became known as the [[Broodmaker]], the [[Silent One]], the [[Unmaker]], and the [[Final Coil]].

The dragons were eventually defeated, and Asgorath was captured by the gods. With his preparation he managed to slay two of the gods, Alea and Ferum. The gods created the [[Material Plane]] as a prison for Asgorath, using [[Ley Lines]] as bars to keep him eternally asleep.

The [[Final Coil]] was the last of the dragons to fall, and is imprisoned with him. The two sometimes stir in their slumber. 

[[Tartarus]] attempted to awaken Asgorath after his escape in the year 5417 AS, but has been unable to as of [[The Shattering]].[^1]
