## Introduction

Asgorath, also known as the World-Shaper, is a Primordial entity and one of the Cosmic Twins. His twin, [[Arambar|Arambar the Titan]], complements him in both power and personality. Asgorath is a figure of immense influence in the cosmic landscape, known for his meticulousness, vision, and impulsiveness. This document delves into the life, abilities, and impact of Asgorath, focusing on his role in the creation of the Universe and the Eternal Wars.

## Origin and Nature

Asgorath is a Primordial being, born from the abstract entities of [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]]. He is one of the Cosmic Twins. While his twin Arambar is quiet, contemplative, and known for his patience, Asgorath is meticulous yet shortsighted, filled with grand visions that he seeks to manifest without hesitation. His essence is deeply tied to both Chaos and Order, making him a complex and powerful entity.

## Creation of the Universe

It was Asgorath's mind that first conceived the idea of the [[Eärendor|Universe]]. Alongside his twin Arambar, he created Time and Aether and began weaving them into the fabric of the Universe. The Cosmic Twins offered each of their family members a plane within this new Universe. While their parents, Chaos and Order, chose to remain distant and disinterested, and their elder siblings [[Selune]] and [[Shar]] opted to stay in almost-time, Asgorath and Arambar went on to create the True Planes. For their Elemental siblings, they each built a Plane, and for themselves, they created the [[Ethereal Plane]]—a realm woven throughout the Universe and connected to all other planes.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Asgorath was a central figure in the Eternal Wars, a cosmic conflict that involved gods, Primordials, and other celestial beings. Initially outnumbered and unprepared, he and Arambar retreated to plan their counterattack. Asgorath's most significant contribution to the war was the creation of the [[Epic Dragons|Dragons]], beings of unparalleled might formed of pure Chaos and Order.

## The Dragons of Chaos and Order

In a desperate move to turn the tide of the Eternal Wars, Asgorath unleashed the Dragons into the Universe. These creatures, though lacking in intelligence, were immensely powerful. Despite their raw might, they were eventually defeated by the gods, who had formed an alliance with [[Tartarus]].

## Capture and Imprisonment

After the defeat of his Dragons, Asgorath was captured by the gods. Though he managed to slay two gods, he was ultimately imprisoned. The gods created the [[Material Plane]] as a prison for Asgorath, using [[Ley Lines]] as bars to keep him eternally asleep.

## Legacy

Asgorath's legacy is a complex tapestry of creation and conflict. His role in shaping the Universe and his subsequent actions during the Eternal Wars have left an indelible mark on the cosmic landscape. His imprisonment serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked ambition and power.

## Conclusion

Asgorath, the World-Shaper, is a being of immense complexity and power. His actions, from the creation of the Universe to his role in the Eternal Wars, have had far-reaching implications. Though now imprisoned, his influence continues to reverberate throughout the cosmos, making him a subject of both awe and scholarly study.
