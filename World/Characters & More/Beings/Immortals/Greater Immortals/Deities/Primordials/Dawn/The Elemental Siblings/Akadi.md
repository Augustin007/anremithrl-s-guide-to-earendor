Akadi was known as the Gentle. She was the youngest of the Elemental Siblings and the Primordial of Air.

Akadi was lighthearted for all of her life and filled with laughter. She was most beloved of her siblings, especially by her sister [[Istishia]], who was fiercely protective of her. 

Akadi turned down [[Dur-baagal]], for instead she loved [[Ubtao|Ubtao the Heartseer]]. She ofted visited Ubtao in the Root Hold.

Her admiration for Ubtao led to a rift between her and her brothers, [[Asgorath]] and [[Grumbar]], who later slew Ubtao for his deception.

[[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]] captured Akadi, which incensed all of her siblings and kicked off [[The Eternal Wars]]. 

Akadi was one of the four creaters of the Celestials, along with [[Kossuth]], [[Istishia]], and [[Atropus]].

She accepted the Celestials and spoke often at their councils, and they considered her one of their own. She forgave them for killing her brother [[Arambar]], just as she forgave all the others for the atrocities they committed in the war. She viewed the celestials as her own children.

She took pains to make her realm habitable to most mortals. She created many beings in her plane, for she loved life.

She was killed by [[Tartarus]] and [[Shar]] on the 9th of Hammer, 5421 AS[^1].
