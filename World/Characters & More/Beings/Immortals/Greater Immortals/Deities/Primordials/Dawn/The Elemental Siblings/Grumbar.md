## Introduction

Grumbar, known as the Steadfast, is one of the Elemental Siblings and a Primordial of Dawn. He is the embodiment of earth and stone, a being of unyielding patience and unwavering resolve. Grumbar is the peace-maker among his siblings, often mediating conflicts and maintaining a sense of balance within the elemental realms.

## Origin

Grumbar emerged from the almost-time, from [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]] — He is younger than the Firstborn and the Cosmic Twins, his elder siblings. He is the eldest of the Elemental Primordials, and the other three are his siblings [[Istishia]], [[Istishia]], and [[Akadi]]. His realm, known as the [[Caverns of Stillness]], is a labyrinthine network of tunnels, chambers, and vast underground landscapes, all made of various forms of earth and stone.

## Personality

Quiet and contemplative, Grumbar is slow to anger but even slower to forgive. His nature is one of stability and endurance, qualities that make him a reliable ally and a formidable foe. Unlike his more volatile siblings, Grumbar values long-term solutions over immediate action, often taking the time to consider the implications of his choices.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

During the Eternal Wars, Grumbar remained largely neutral, refusing to take sides in the conflicts that tore apart the Primordial families. However, when the Dawn was threatened by the malevolent actions of [[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]], Grumbar stood by the Cosmic Twins, [[Arambar]] and [[Asgorath]]. His unwavering support was instrumental in the eventual defeat of the rebellious Primordials. Though it was short-lived.

## The Gift of Free Will
Grumbar was among the gods affected by Arambar's final act, which granted free will to all divine beings. Though initially skeptical of this newfound autonomy, Grumbar eventually embraced.

## The Celestials
Grumbar was the only one of the Primordials that did not participate in the formation of the Celestial Council, choosing instead to focus on the restoration and governance of his own realm. However, he maintains a cautious relationship with the Celestials, ever wary of their collective might and the potential threat they pose to the elemental realms.

## Conclusion
Grumbar remains a pillar of stability in a universe marked by chaos and conflict. His realm, the Caverns of Stillness, serves as a sanctuary for those seeking respite from the turmoil of the Eternal Wars.
