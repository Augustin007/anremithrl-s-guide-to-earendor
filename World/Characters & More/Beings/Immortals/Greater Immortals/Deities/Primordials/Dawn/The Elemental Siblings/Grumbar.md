Grumbar is the eldest of the Elemental Siblings, and the Primordial of Earth. He is known as the Steadfast. 


Grumbar is slow to anger but even slower to forgive. His nature is one of stability and endurance, qualities that make him a reliable ally and a formidable foe.

He was closest to [[Asgorath]] and [[Arambar]].

He helped Asgorath kill [[Ubtao]], to the anger of their sister [[Akadi]].

[[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]] slowed down the time in his realm substantially when they unbalanced the time of the world.

He was the last to join [[The Eternal Wars]], and stood for a long while with Arambar and Asgorath.

During the Eternal Wars, Grumbar remained largely neutral, refusing to take sides in the conflicts that tore apart the Primordial families. However, when the Dawn was threatened by the malevolent actions of [[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]], Grumbar stood by the Cosmic Twins, [[Arambar]] and [[Asgorath]]. His unwavering support was instrumental in the eventual defeat of the rebellious Primordials. 

He mostly ignored the foundation of Arvandor and the creation of mortals. Time ran slower and slower in his realm.

He was a friend of [[Iskandar]][^1]

As of 5421 AS, he discovered his sister Akadi's murder when his realm was stabilised by the Conduit.
