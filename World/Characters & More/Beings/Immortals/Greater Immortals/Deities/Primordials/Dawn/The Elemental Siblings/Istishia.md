## Introduction
Istishia, also known as Istishia the Terrible, is one of the Primordials of Dawn, a sibling to [[Grumbar]], [[Istishia]], and [[Akadi]]. She is the embodiment of water, ever-changing and moody, a force of both creation and destruction. This document delves into the complex nature of Istishia, her role in the cosmology, and her influence on the unfolding events of the Eternal Wars.

## Realm
Istishia's realm is known as the [[Cresting Spires]], a plane where water can be as still as a pond one moment and as turbulent as a stormy sea the next. Towering waves rise and fall, reflecting her ever-changing nature.

## Role in the Primordials of Dawn
Istishia was initially unmoved by the Cosmic Twins' call to arms against the Primordials of Dusk. However, her stance changed when [[Dur-baagal]] captured Akadi, and she aided them in toppling [[Atropus]] and Dur-baagal. Eventually, though, when Atropus and Dur-baagal severed ties, she betrayed her siblings and joined Atropus. Istishia's betrayal led to a cataclysmic battle with her brother Kossuth, fracturing the alliance among the Elemental siblings.

## The Creation of the Celestials
Atropus sought her help in creating the Celestials along with Akadi and Kossuth, beings of divine power designed to counter Dur-baagal's Elohim. When Atropus turned the Celestials against the rest of his allies, Istishia also turned on him after he refused to show mercy to her sister Akadi. 

### Loyalty to Akadi
Istishia's relationship with her sister Akadi is one of the few constants in her otherwise unpredictable existence. While Istishia is loved by many but loves none back, Akadi is the exception. The bond between the two sisters is strong, transcending the usual elemental rivalries and cosmic politics. Istishia's fierce protective instinct for Akadi was evident when she turned against Atropus, choosing familial loyalty over strategic alliance.

## Conclusion
Istishia is a complex and unpredictable Primordial, her actions and moods as variable as the waters she embodies. Her role in the Eternal Wars has been pivotal, yet her ultimate loyalties and intentions remain as elusive as ever.
