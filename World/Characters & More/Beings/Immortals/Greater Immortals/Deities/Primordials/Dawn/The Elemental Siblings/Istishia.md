Istishia is known as the Terrible, and is the Primordial of Water. She is known to be ever-changing and moody.

Istishia was initially unmoved by the Cosmic Twins' call to arms against the Primordials of Dusk. However, her stance changed when [[Dur-baagal]] captured Akadi, and she aided them in toppling [[Atropus]] and Dur-baagal. Eventually, though, when Atropus and Dur-baagal severed ties, she betrayed her siblings and joined Atropus. Istishia's betrayal led to a cataclysmic battle with her brother Kossuth, fracturing the alliance among the Elemental siblings.

Atropus sought her help in creating the Celestials along with Akadi and Kossuth, beings of divine power designed to counter Dur-baagal's Elohim. When Atropus turned the Celestials against the rest of his allies, Istishia also turned on him after he refused to show mercy to her sister Akadi. 

She lost a lot of her power to the [[Broodmaker]], and is still recovering from [[Asgorath]]'s betrayal.

She created the merfolk at the insistence of Akadi, but otherwise ignored mortals.
