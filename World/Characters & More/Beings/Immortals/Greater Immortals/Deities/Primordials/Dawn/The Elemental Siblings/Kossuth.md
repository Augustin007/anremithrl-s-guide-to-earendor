## Introduction

Kossuth, known as the Fierce, is a Primordial of the Dawn, a being of immense power and influence. He is the embodiment of fire, a force of warmth and destruction, loyalty and wrath. This document delves into the complex nature of Kossuth, his role in the cosmology, and his impact on the Eternal Wars.

## Origin

Kossuth emerged as one of the Elemental Siblings, born from the almost-time before the true beginning of the age of the Primordials. He is fiercely loyal, particularly to his younger sister [[Akadi]], who he adores, and to his older brother [[Asgorath]], the World-Shaper, who crafted his plane, and who he greatly admires.

## Personality

Kossuth is quick to rise in anger but also quick to forgive. His nature is dualistic: warm and kind when at peace, but fierce and destructive when provoked. His loyalty is unwavering, making him a steadfast ally but a fearsome enemy.

## Realm

Kossuth's realm is the [[Undying Pyre]], a landscape of fire where rivers of lava flow through mountains of flame. The realm is a spectacle of beauty, with fires of all colors illuminating the wonders therein.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Kossuth was one of the few Primordials who stood by the Cosmic Twins, [[Arambar]] and Asgorath, during the Eternal Wars. Though he arrived late to aid them in their initial defeat, his loyalty never wavered. He was the first to attack when Akadi was captured by [[Dur-baagal]], and he stood by the Cosmic Twins and Grumbar in their counterattacks.

## Relationships

#### Akadi

Kossuth shares a special bond with his younger sister Akadi, the Primordial of air. He is fiercely protective of her and is quick to come to her aid whenever she is in danger.

#### Asgorath

Kossuth holds a deep respect for Asgorath, the World-Shaper, who crafted his plane. This loyalty was evident during the Eternal Wars, where Kossuth was one of the few who stood by the Cosmic Twins.

#### Istishia

Kossuth has a complex relationship with Istishia, his elemental sibling of water. During the Eternal Wars, their alliance broke apart, leading to cataclysmic battles that reshaped the planes.


## The Celestials

Kossuth played a pivotal role in the creation of the Celestials, a race of divine beings designed to counter the malevolent Elohim crafted by Dur-baagal. When [[Atropus]] sought allies to forge these new entities, Kossuth was among the first to lend his fiery essence to the endeavor. His participation was driven by his intense loathing for Dur-baagal, who had captured his beloved sister Akadi, and his unwavering loyalty to the Cosmic Twins. Kossuth's contribution to the Celestials had a lasting impact. His fiery essence became a core aspect of their being, and even after gaining free will, many Celestials continued to exhibit traits that could be traced back to Kossuth's influence.

## Legacy

Kossuth's legacy is one of fierce loyalty and unwavering resolve. Though quick to anger, his capacity for forgiveness and his steadfast nature make him a complex but ultimately noble figure in the cosmology.

## Conclusion

Kossuth, the Primordial of Fire, is a being of immense complexity. His dualistic nature, fierce loyalty, and role in the Eternal Wars make him a key figure in the cosmological tapestry. His realm, the Undying Pyre, serves as a testament to both his creative and destructive capabilities, making him a force to be reckoned with in any narrative concerning the Primordials.
