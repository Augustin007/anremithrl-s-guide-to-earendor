Kossuth was the strongest of the elemental siblings, known as the fierce and loyal. He is the primordial of flame.

Kossuth emerged as one of the Elemental Siblings, born from the almost-time before the true beginning of the age of the Primordials. He is fiercely loyal, particularly to his younger sister [[Akadi]], who he adores

He was once loyal to his older brother [[Asgorath]], the World-Shaper, who crafted his plane, and who he greatly admired, but he has not forgiven Asgorath for betraying him during the Eternal Wars.

Kossuth is quick to rise in anger but also usually quick to forgive. His nature is dualistic: warm and kind when at peace, but fierce and destructive when provoked. His loyalty is unwavering, making him a steadfast ally but a fearsome enemy.

He likes building and light and beauty and was thus close friends with [[Telos]]. He taught Telos a lot when Telos was but newly formed. Later, when Telos had long outgrown his teaching, and they were both the masters of their crafts, the two worked together and crafted the [[Sword of Eons]].

Kossuth was unpredictable, and often tossed aside unfinished works, and Telos took them up and finished him, and Kossuth developed some affection for the lesser primordial. 

Kossuth was one of the few Primordials who stood by the Cosmic Twins, [[Arambar]] and Asgorath, during the Eternal Wars. Though he arrived late to aid them in their initial defeat, his loyalty never wavered. He was the first to attack when Akadi was captured by [[Dur-baagal]], and he stood by the Cosmic Twins and Grumbar in their counterattacks.

Kossuth helped [[Nehusta]] build a new body for Telos, and kept the Sword of Eons after Telos put it aside.

He aided in the creation of the Celestials.

He attended the council of Celestials, and aided the [[Righteous Council]] during the Sundering War. He spent the war holding off [[Shar]]. 

He created the first unbreakable oath with [[Althazar the Bright]] and used it to channel his powers. This was the first instance of a warlock. From this bond came the [[Flameheart]][^1]

He blames himself for not being quick enough to stop Akadi's death and plots terrible revenge.
