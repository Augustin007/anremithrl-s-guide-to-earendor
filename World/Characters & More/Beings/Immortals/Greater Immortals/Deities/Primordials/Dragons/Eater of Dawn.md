The Eater of Dawn was the first of the dragons, created by [[Arambar]] and [[Asgorath]]. It was it who killed [[The Celestials#The Eight Fallen|The Eight Fallen]] along with its creators. It was defeated and destroyed by the Celestials in the same battle in which it came to life. 

The remnants of its soul were locked away into the planes, scattered in Seron's Scar.
