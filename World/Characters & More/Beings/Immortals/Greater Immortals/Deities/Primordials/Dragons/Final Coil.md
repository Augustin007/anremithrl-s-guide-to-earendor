The Final Coil was one of the four dragons made by [[Asgorath]] after the deaths of [[Arambar]] and the [[Eater of Dawn]].  She was the most cunning and skilled of the dragons, and grew to become Asgorath's favourite. She avoided every trap laid out by the Celestials, forcing them to face her and Asgorath in single combat. Her remnant would be binded alongside Asgorath's in the foundations of the mortal plane.

She disliked the [[Broodmaker]], but Asgorath convinced her that he was necessary for their rule.

She remains asleep, but occasionally stirs.[^1]
