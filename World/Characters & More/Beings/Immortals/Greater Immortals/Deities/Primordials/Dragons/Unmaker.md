The Unmaker was one of the four dragons made by [[Asgorath]] after the deaths of [[Arambar]] and the [[Eater of Dawn]].  

The Unmaker was shaken by the Broodmaker's murder of the [[Silent One]], and spoke to [[Tartarus]], betraying its kind. It revealed secrets it should not have to Tartarus, and thought it had made an ally of the celestials, but Tartarus did not inform the Celestials, and used this offer to trick it and kill it along with the Celestials. Its soul is locked in the Abyss.
