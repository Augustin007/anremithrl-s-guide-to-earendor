## Introduction

Atropus, also known as the Elder Evil, is a malevolent Primordial figure in the cosmic narrative. He is a harbinger of entropy, decay, and destruction. Initially a part of the Primordials of Dusk, Atropus eventually becomes a central antagonist, leading rebellions and manipulating events to serve his dark ambitions.

## Origin and Characteristics

Atropus came into existence as one of the Primordials of Dusk. Unlike his peers, he embodies the essence of destruction and decay. He is known for consuming Aether and leaving behind pure negative energy. His nature sets him apart, making him a feared and isolated figure among both the Dawn and Dusk.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Atropus plays a pivotal role in the Eternal Wars, leading the rebellion alongside [[Dur-baagal]], the Cold and Cruel. Initially successful, their alliance eventually crumbles due to internal conflicts and the intervention of the Cosmic Twins, [[Asgorath]] and [[Arambar]]. His manipulation extends to sowing discord among the Elemental siblings, leading to infighting and weakening the Dawn's unity.

## Creation of the Celestials

Not to be outdone by Dur-baagal's Elohim, [[Atropus]] collaborates with [[Kossuth]], [[Akadi]], and [[Istishia]] to create the Celestials—beings of divine power. These Celestials are initially used to counter Dur-baagal's Elohim but later serve Atropus' darker purposes.

## Betrayal and Manipulation

After the defeat of Dur-baagal, Atropus seizes control of the Celestials, turning them against his former allies. 

## Downfall and Legacy

Atropus meets his end when the Celestials, granted free will by Arambar's final act, rebel against him. Despite his downfall, his actions leave an indelible mark on the cosmic landscape, contributing to the ongoing chaos and setting the stage for future conflicts.

## Conclusion

Atropus is a complex figure whose actions drive much of the cosmic narrative's conflict. His thirst for destruction and manipulation make him a formidable antagonist, and his legacy continues to influence the balance of power in the universe.
