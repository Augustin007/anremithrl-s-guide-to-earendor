Atropus came into existence as an effect of the creation of the Universe, and was a Dusk Primordial. 

He was deeply annoyed at the lack of consideration by the Dawn in regards to the Dusk. And had a number of grievances against the Cosmic Twins in particular. [[Grumbar]] called him the most intelligent of the dusk[^1].

He plotted for a long time, and deeply, and listened to the councils of [[Shar]] and [[Tartarus]], and recognised their attempts to manipulate him, but fell for it anyways. He learned from them and used this knowledge to gain the aid of [[Dur-baagal]], who felt spurned by [[Istishia]] and [[Akadi]]. 

Atropus garnered the sympathy of [[Nehusta]] and [[Telos]][^2], but failed to convert them fully to his side. He tricked them into becoming a distraction when he and Dur-baagal attempted to reshape a region of the Planes to make their own. It failed badly, forcing them to absorb a vast amount of quiddity, overwriting the twins' will and leaving behind pure negative energy, imbalancing the flow of time and wrecking the planes. The centre of their action was pulled towards the [[Abyss]], and became the [[The Dark Regions|Dark Regions]]. 

Atropus was able to convince [[Ubtao]], who had seen them, to keep it a secret as the twins attempted to discover what had happened. But as the Dawn suspected them, Atropus and Dur-baagal fled, and Shar hid them. Atropus pressured Ubtao to aid them, lest Atropus reveal Ubtao's concealment of the culprits. But before the last of Atropus's plans could fall in place, Dur-baagal, emboldened, began the attack and took Akadi for himself.

This would begin the Eternal Wars. 

At one point in the wars, and in an attempt to rival Dur-baagal's Elohim. 

[[Atropus]] collaborated with [[Kossuth]], [[Akadi]], and [[Istishia]] to create the Celestials, but secretly built into them obedience to him, and used the Celestials to win many victories until [[Arambar]] freed them from his will, and they rebelled against him, destroying him.
