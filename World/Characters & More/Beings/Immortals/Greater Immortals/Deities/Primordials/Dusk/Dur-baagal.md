## Introduction

Dur-baagal, known as the Cold and Cruel, is a Primordial of immense power and malevolence. Born during the age of the Primordials of Dusk, he has been a central figure in the shaping of the cosmos and the Eternal Wars that have raged between the Primordials of Dawn and Dusk.

## Origins

Dur-baagal came into existence as one of the Primordials of Dusk, beings who were neither of the same essence nor power as their predecessors, the Primordials of Dawn. He was born from the ever-expanding tapestry of existence and was more bound to his form and essence, tied closely to Aether and Time.

## Personality

Dur-baagal embodies the essence of frigid desolation. He revels in the stillness that extreme cold brings, a stillness that can halt even the flow of Time itself. His realm, Frostfell, is a reflection of his own cold and cruel nature.

### Unrequited Desires

Dur-baagal harbored desires for [[Akadi]] and [[Istishia]]. After being scorned by both, he secluded himself in [[Frostfell]], a Paraelemental Plane between the realms of Akadi and Istishia. This rejection fueled his cold and cruel nature, further isolating him from potential allies.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Dur-baagal played a pivotal role in the Eternal Wars, initially leading the rebellion alongside [[Atropus]], the Elder Evil. His capture of Akadi, the youngest and most beloved of the Dawn Primordials, incited the wrath of the entire Dawn, leading to a counterattack that drove out the rebellion.
### The Scorn of the Dawn

After his failed attempt to take Akadi for himself, Dur-baagal was scorned and ostracized by all the Primordials. He found himself without allies, a pariah even among the Dusk.

### Creation of the Elohim

Seeking to tip the scales in his favor, Dur-baagal created the Elohim, beings of immense power but limited will. These beings were instrumental in instilling fear into the Dawn for the first time. 

## Downfall and Legacy

Dur-baagal's downfall began when the Celestials, beings of divine power, were created to counter the Elohim. He was forced to flee to the [[Abyss]], losing control of the Elohim and ultimately facing defeat at the hands of the Celestials.

## Conclusion

Dur-baagal remains a complex and malevolent figure in the cosmology of the universe. His actions have had far-reaching consequences, shaping the Eternal Wars and leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of reality. Though defeated, his legacy endures, a testament to the destructive power that the Primordials wield.
