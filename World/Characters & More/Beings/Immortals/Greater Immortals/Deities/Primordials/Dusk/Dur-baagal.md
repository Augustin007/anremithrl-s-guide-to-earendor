Dur-baagal was a Primordial of Dusk. 

He harbored desires for [[Akadi]] and [[Istishia]]. After being scorned by both, he secluded himself in [[Frostfell]], a Paraelemental Plane between the realms of Akadi and Istishia. His edict froze the plane over, and from him it is that the name comes from. His lingering intent still permeates the plane.

Dur-baagal followed [[Atropus]] into his rebellion, hoping to take Akadi for himself. When he felt Atropus was being too careful and not ambitious enough, he broke away from Atropus and struck at the Dawn with the allies they had gathered, and took Akadi for himself, which would begin the Eternal Wars.

After his failed attempt to take Akadi for himself, Dur-baagal, and his failed attempt to conquer the Universe rashly, he was unable to gain allies.

Dur-baagal eventually created the Elohim, beings of immense power but limited will. He used them to drive away all the others for some time, until Atropus defeated him with the Celestials. He ceded control of the Elohim to Atropus and fled from the universe into the [[Abyss]]. When the Celestials arrived at the abyss, he was killed by [[Auril]]. His essense did not scatter but was absorbed and given to Auril by Shar.
