Nehusta came into existence as one of the Primordials of Dusk. She fell in love with [[Telos]]. She also was a friend of [[Akadi]].

Nehusta and Telos loved to build and dwelled in pockets between the planes, populating them with beautiful creations. From them in this time came the Elessar, the eldest of the gods, born of their conjoined power and will and intent to build beauty. Powerful beings that loved building and wonder and assisted in the building of many wondrous things.

Forced into the conflict to protect their creations, Nehusta and Telos turned the Elessar away from building and into fighting. Many of the Elessar were slain or undone, and many of  their great creations were destroyed. In the end, Telos was gravely wounded, and Nehusta was barely able to create for him a new body. The two fled the Universe thereafter, and dwell in [[Elysium]] with [[Selune]], creating things.

Nehusta is easily inspired and easily distracted, always beginning new projects with a burst of enthusiasm but rarely seeing them to completion. Her essence is a vibrant tapestry of ideas and possibilities, making her the epitome of creativity. She is the perfect counterpoint to Telos' methodical nature, and her imagination breathes life into his meticulous plans.
