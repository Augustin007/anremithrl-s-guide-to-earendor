She is the vibrant tapestry of ideas, the embodiment of spontaneity, and the muse of the ever-changing universe. This document delves into the intricate layers of her existence, her role in the cosmology, and her impact on the Eternal Wars.

## Origin

Nehusta came into existence as one of the Primordials of Dusk, born from the ever-expanding tapestry of existence. She is the wife of [[Telos]], the Unstoppable, and together they dwelltin [[The Architects' Pockets|pockets]] of Aether and Time that burgeon into demiplanes. 

## Personality

Nehusta is easily inspired and easily distracted, always beginning new projects with a burst of enthusiasm but rarely seeing them to completion. Her essence is a vibrant tapestry of ideas and possibilities, making her the epitome of creativity. She is the perfect counterpoint to Telos' methodical nature, and her imagination breathes life into his meticulous plans.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Forced into the conflict to protect their creations, Nehusta and Telos turned the Elessar away from building and into fighting. Many of the Elessar were slain or undone, and slowly their great creations were destroyed. However, Nehusta played a crucial role in the rebirth of Telos, crafting for him a new body that was unstoppable in its might.

Nehusta and Telos abandoned the [[Eärendor|Universe]] and their creations during the Eternal Wars, and they sought refuge in [[Elysium]] with [[Selune]].

## The Elessar

Nehusta and Telos are the creators of the Elessar, the eldest of the gods. The Elessar were initially created to assist in the building of many wondrous things within their pocket realms. However, the Eternal Wars forced a shift in their purpose, turning them into protectors and warriors.

## Legacy

Nehusta's legacy is one of balance and harmony, especially in her relationship with Telos. Where Telos provides the focus and determination to see a project through, Nehusta infuses it with creativity and flair. Despite the tragedies and conflicts that have marred her existence, her essence remains a beacon of what could be, a testament to the endless possibilities of creation.

## Conclusion

Nehusta, the Builder, is a complex and multi-faceted being whose influence extends beyond her own realm. Her creativity and spontaneity have left an indelible mark on the universe, making her an essential part of the cosmological tapestry. As one of the Primordials of Dusk, she stands as a symbol of the endless potential and variability that define existence itself.
