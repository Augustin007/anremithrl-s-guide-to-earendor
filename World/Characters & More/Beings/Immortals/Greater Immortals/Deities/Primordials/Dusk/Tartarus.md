## Introduction

Tartarus is a Primordial being, a figure of immense power and complexity who dwells in the [[Abyss]]. Unlike other Primordials, Tartarus exhibits a nature more akin to the Dawn, making him a unique entity among his peers. This document aims to explore the enigmatic character of Tartarus, his alliances, and his role in the cosmic events that have shaped the Universe.

## Origin

Tartarus was born from the edges of the [[Eärendor|Universe]], formed from the quasi-planes that materialized where the Universe touched the beyond. His essence is a blend of the Abyss and elements that are beyond Aether and Time, making him a creature of Emptiness.

## Characteristics

Tartarus is a creature of destruction, much like his wife [[Shar]], with whom he shares an unbreakable bond. The two are always of one mind, and no strife or lies have ever passed between them. His nature sets him apart from other Primordials of Dusk, aligning him more closely with the Dawn.

## Alliances and Conflicts

### The Eternal Wars

Tartarus played a passive role in the Eternal Wars, orchestrating events from the Abyss and watching the evil unfold. He later joined forces with [[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]], albeit temporarily, to tip the scales in favor of the Dusk.

### Alliance with the Gods

During the rise of the [[Epic Dragons|Dragons]], Tartarus allied himself with the gods to defeat these new threats. His alliance was not just out of admiration for [[Auril]]'s prowess but also out of a primal need for survival. He helped the gods trick and defeat the Dragons but retreated once the immediate danger had passed.

## Role in the Imprisonment of Asgorath

Tartarus did not participate in the capture and imprisonment of [[Asgorath]]. His alliance with the gods was limited to the defeat of the Dragons, and he returned to the Abyss once that objective was achieved.

## Conclusion

Tartarus is a Primordial of great power and complexity, whose actions and alliances have had a profound impact on the cosmic balance. His unique nature and strategic alliances make him a key player in the unfolding drama of the Universe, yet his ultimate goals remain as enigmatic as the Abyss he calls home.
