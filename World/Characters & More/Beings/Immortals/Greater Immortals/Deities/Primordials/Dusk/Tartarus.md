Tartarus was born among the Dusk from the very edges of the Universe and the [[Abyss]], But he was more akin to the firstborn than to the Dusk, both in level of power and in temperament, and never took a liking for time and space, choosing instead to dwell deep in the Abyss, where he developed a connection with [[Shar]]. The two are always of one mind, and no strife or lies have ever passed between them.

He was a creature of destruction, that delighted in suffering, and so was Shar, and the two became greatly united, and developed a strange sort of care for the other. 

He and Shar saw [[Atropus]] wishing to rebel and encouraged him, lying and offering support. While he saw through their lies, and succefully manipulated them into helping more than once[^1], their encouragement and manipulation did affect him and he would not have begun to gather allies. Tartarus subtly convinced [[Dur-baagal]] that Atropus was being too careful and too slow and enticed him to begin his attack on his own, causing the Eternal Wars.

He protected the Celestials from the epic dragons, since it angered Asgorath, and had [[Auril]] and Dur-baagal fight to the death for his amusement, and agreed to aid the winner. When Auril won he helped the Celestials win the Eternal Wars.

During this time, Tharizdun developed a fondness for [[Tharizdun]] and [[Acheron]], who did not get along with each other, and so it was that when Tharizdun was hurt, and Asmodeus asked for Tartarus's help, Tartarus put a bit of his essence into Tharizdun. 

He and Shar used that bit of essense to talk to Tharizdun, and convinced him to begin the Sundering War, which they saw as just an extension of the Eternal Wars. 

Tartarus was eventually tricked and captured by the [[Lady of Pain]][^2]. He siphoned of [[Ashdilkir]]'s sanity to survive [[The Labyrinth of Insanity]]. He was freed by [[Nil'ge'tar Remshi'ul|Nil'ge'tar]] shortly before Nugget's original death[^2], and began preparing to destroy the Tree of Sanctuary to awaken Asgorath[^1].

Asmodeus claimed that Tartarus was the only primordial who ever scared him.[^1]
