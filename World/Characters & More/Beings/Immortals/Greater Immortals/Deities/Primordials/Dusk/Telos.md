## Introduction

Telos, known as the Unstoppable, is a Primordial of Dusk. He embodies the essence of persistence, focus, and methodical building. This document aims to explore the facets of his existence, his role in the cosmological framework, and his impact on the Eternal Wars.

## Origin

Telos emerged as a Primordial of Dusk, born from the ever-expanding fabric of reality. He is the husband of [[Nehusta]], the Builder, and together they inhabited [[The Architects' Pockets|pockets]] of Aether and Time that have blossomed into demiplanes.

## Personality

Telos is a methodical builder, crafting things of great utility but often lacking in aesthetic beauty. He only embarks on projects he believes he can complete, embodying the essence of persistence and focus. His methodical nature serves as the perfect counterbalance to Nehusta's spontaneity, and his meticulous plans provide the structure for her creative flair.

## Role in the Eternal Wars

Telos, along with Nehusta, was reluctantly drawn into the Eternal Wars to defend their creations. The Elessar, their divine progeny, were repurposed from builders to warriors. During the conflict, Telos suffered a grievous wound that nearly led to his dissolution. However, thanks to Nehusta's intervention and a grand work of creation, he was reborn in a new, unstoppable form.

Nehusta and Telos abandoned the [[Eärendor|Universe]] and their creations during the Eternal Wars, and they sought refuge in [[Elysium]] with [[Selune]].

## The Elessar

Telos co-created the Elessar with Nehusta, initially as aids for their building projects within their pocket realms. These beings later became warriors during the Eternal Wars, and many were lost or undone. Telos' rebirth was a pivotal moment, marking a shift in the balance of power and influencing the course of the war.
## Legacy

Telos stands as a symbol of unyielding determination and focus. His methodical approach to creation has left a lasting impact on the universe, serving as a counterpoint to the chaotic and ever-changing nature of existence. Despite the trials and tribulations of the Eternal Wars, Telos remains a beacon of what can be achieved through persistence and careful planning.

## Conclusion

Telos, the Unstoppable, is a complex entity whose influence is felt across the cosmological landscape. His unwavering focus and determination make him an essential part of the universe's intricate tapestry. As a Primordial of Dusk, he represents the unyielding drive to build and create, even in the face of overwhelming odds.
