## Introduction
Ubtao, once known as the Heartseer, was a Primordial of unique abilities and complex allegiances. He possessed the rare gift of perceiving the hearts and minds of all beings, a gift that eventually led to his downfall. This document delves into the life, abilities, and ultimate betrayal of Ubtao, who was later named the Deceiver.

## Origins
Ubtao was a Primordial of Dusk, born from the ever-expanding tapestry of existence. Unlike his more malevolent or elemental siblings, Ubtao was more introspective, preferring the quiet depths of the Root Hold within the [[Caverns of Stillness]]. His unique ability allowed him to perceive the innermost thoughts and feelings of all beings, even those as distant and enigmatic as [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]].

## Akadi
[[Akadi]] was the only Primordial who could visit Ubtao without disturbing him. And she loved him. And when he was slain she was greatly saddened.

## The Eternal Wars and Betrayal
During the Eternal Wars, Ubtao found himself in a precarious position. When questioned by the Cosmic Twins about the destruction wrought by Atropus and Dur-baagal, he chose to lie, sowing seeds of doubt and suggesting that the destruction could have been an accident. This act earned him the title of the Deceiver.

## Downfall
His betrayal was eventually discovered by the Cosmic Twins. In a final confrontation in the Root Hold, Ubtao was slain by [[Asgorath]] and [[Grumbar]], his essence scattered across the planes. This act caused a rift between Akadi and her brothers, as she had admired Ubtao and was angered by his death.

## Legacy
Ubtao's legacy is one of complexity and tragedy. His unique abilities could have made him a mediator and peacemaker, but instead, they led him down a path of deception and ultimately to his demise. His actions during the Eternal Wars had far-reaching consequences, affecting the alliances and outcomes of many battles.

## Conclusion
Ubtao, the Deceiver, remains a cautionary tale in the annals of Primordial history. His choices during critical moments shaped the course of the Eternal Wars and left an indelible mark on the relationships between the Primordials. Though his essence is scattered, the impact of his actions continues to reverberate through the planes.
