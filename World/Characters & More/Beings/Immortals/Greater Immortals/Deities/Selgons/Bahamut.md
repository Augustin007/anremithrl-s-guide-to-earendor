Bahamut is the son of one of the Epic Gods. He was the son of the [[Silent One]] and of [[Iris]], but his parents were killed by the [[Broodmaker]].  The broodmaker loved him more than [[Tiamat]], his own daughter. Bahamut was used as bait to kill the Broodmaker.

When the Arvandorics won, [[Thalorin]] insisted they spare [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]]. He initially hated the Arvandorics, but grew to love them. 

Bahamut has seven great golden dragons as servants. They are his closest companions. They usually maintain the form of seven canaries.

He is known as the god of foresight and wisdom.

He and his seven separated [[Naras Vorasthar]] and his companions and subjected them each to individual tests. Out of these tests [[Torquil Leogan|Torquil]] gained clericdom of Bahamut, and [[Liriel Danstal]] gained the [[Codex of Abraham the Mage]].[^1]

He often projects himself as a strange wizard with seven canaries, calling himself Fizban.

He possesed Torquil during the destruction of Hreghalk[^2]. His light temporarily melted away [[Giggle Jiggles]].
