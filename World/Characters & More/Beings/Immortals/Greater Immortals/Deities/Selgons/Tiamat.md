Tiamat was born of [[Rhea]] and the [[Broodmaker]]. Her father killed her mother shortly thereafter, and thus by virtue of her existence, she earned the emnity of her half-sister [[Auril]]. 

Although Tiamat inherited her father's cunning, she did not inherit his cruelty. The Broodmaker, her father, was the cruelest of the lot, and thus he found her too gentle for his liking, and preferred her more ruthless cousin [[Bahamut]], whose parents he had killed.

She was neglected and hated by her father. He cast her aside and used her for the cruelest of missions. She learned to turn off her gentleness, and forget who she was, to become the tool her father needed, and to become someone calloused when he despised her, and to forget it all when she could, to be proud and ambitious, all to earn the favour of her father. She refused to let herself think of one thing during a different one, realising it caused her pain to remember who she was. Beginning to cope, dividing her memories, sealing her emotions, slowly seeing her aspects as distinct until her mind began to see itself as five minds, until each aspect of her was no longer one. 

Eventually, she was captured by the gods, but shown love and mercy, and taken in by her mother's husband Azmodeus, though she was still hated by her sister.

The compartmentalization did not go away, and by the end of the eternal wars, her form changed to reflect that, becoming a five-headed dragon, and each aspect had become its own person.

[[Vorrak]], the Black.
She became emotionless. She became cold and patient and distant. She took the memories of beatings and pain. She endured humiliation and punishment without breaking. A vessel for pain and endurance. Vorrak learned to take the Broodmaker’s wrath and to feel nothing. Her voice was the last to speak, ever shy, the keeper of shame and silence. Isendra thought her the bravest, but Vorrak never felt that way, instead constantly desiring to cringe away and to hide.
Vorrak cared the most about the other heads, and Isendra was her favourite. Vorrak best remembered they were once one.

[[Zephyrax]], the Blue.
The commander. Ambitious and proud, she was the face Tiamat wore before her father when he was not angry. She was the one who sought approval through domination. Zephyrax came from Tiamat's attempts to be the daughter that her father had wanted. The manipulator and leader. Zephyrax carried the need for control — the desperate logic that said if she could predict her father’s moods, she could stop the next blow. She became commanding, ambitious, and cruel when frightened. Zephyrax later wedded [[Archduke Mammon]] of the Hells to gain dominion over [[Minauros]]. The rest of Tiamat did not consider themselves married to Minauros, only considering Zephyrax to be married.

[[Nymthar]], the Green.
The survivor. Paranoid, cunning, and devouring, she bore Tiamat’s fear — the constant vigilance of the abused. She consumed anything that might threaten them. She trusted nothing, not even his own thoughts, and expected betrayal in every kindness. Every act was formed of that purpose. Survival was her sole thought and command. 

[[Ignaroth]], the Red.
His purpose was to act where the others froze and hesitated. To be impulsive and wrathful and destructive and unreserved and without morals. The avenger. Pure impulse, untempered greed, rage unbound. Ignaroth was the echo of the Broodmaker’s voice inside her, the part that learned to love destruction rather than suffer it. His visage looked uncomfortably like her father's, and the others feared him.

[[Isendra]], the White.
Cold. Clear minded. She best retained the fragments of Tiamat’s original self. The intellect and compassion and capacity to dream. Who fronted when she felt safe and alone, but never hid away altogether. The others all respected her deep intelligence and considered her the bravest of the bunch.


The five heads together awakened [[Magnar]]'s dragonhood.

When [[The Sundering War]] began, she followed her adoptive father [[Asmodeus]], for she was completely loyal to him, and terrified of losing his love and approval.

She had a [[Dagger of Tiamat|dagger]], which she lost during the Sundering War.

After the Sundering War, Tiamat spent much time converting mortals to her will and giving them the power of dragons. Each head maintained a different champion, one true dragon to represent their will. 

[[Tormac]] had her dagger for some time, and eventually became Nymthar's champion. He would subsequently lose the dagger in battle against [[Richard Iwaelfhem|Richard]]. [^4]

[[Vorrak]]'s champion [[Valthor Remshi]] attempted to break them out of [[The Nine Hells]], but Auril tricked Tiamat and escaped instead[^1].

After the previous champion had died. Ignaroth attempted to make [[William Treaty]] his champion. But though he began the process, he ultimately refused[^2].

In the year 5420 AS, her champions were Valthor Remshi for Vorrak, [[Thadurak]] for Zephyrax, Tormac for Nymthar, [[Ardor]] for Ignaroth, and [[Aberion]] for Isendra.[^3]

The five disagreed on whether they should support [[Tartarus]] and it resulted in Aberion and Valthor's deaths at the tree in early 5421 AS, causing [[The Earthquake]]. [^3]

By the end, her heads had forgotten they were truly one, and when [[Jess Val|Lady Black]] visited [[The Nine Hells]], offering pardon and escape for whomever would aid against Tartarus, Isendra used her aid to trick and destroy the other heads.[^3] While this affected her physical form and the strength of the others, and allowed Isendra to permanently front, the other minds did not fully leave her.[^5]

Tiamat was destroyed during [[The Shattering]], where Isendra was aiding the battle against Tartarus.
