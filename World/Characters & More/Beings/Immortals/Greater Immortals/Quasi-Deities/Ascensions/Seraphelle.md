The goddess of art.

An artist and engineer. She was granted immortality by Nehusta. She is considered the goddess of art.

[[William Treaty]] considered her when seeking allies during the events leading up to [[The Shattering]] but ultimately figured she was too unreliably reachable to devote time to.[^1]
