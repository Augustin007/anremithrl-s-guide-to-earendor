The Dracolich of Karr was created to guard [[Vecna]]'s left hand.

It made an alliance with [[Bechel of Bharam]], giving her slaves and prisoners from his take, but would not suffer her to come near the hand. [^1][^2]

The creature was massive in size, with dark scales. It had razor-sharp claws and teeth that can tear through armor like paper. Its eyes were a deep red color, glowing fiercely like embers in a fire. 

At some point someone hid the Oathbreaker Sword in the vault alongside the hand,[^4]

[[Miyatol Dodonus]] sensed a dark presense while in the caves of Karr, and gathered his friends [[Daedroy]], [[Tyko]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], to fight it.[^1]

It killed [[Daedroy]] and [[Tyko]], as well as enslaved [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]]. During this time it also took the [[Oathbow]] from Richard. Richard and Miyatol were forced to flee. They were able to take the bodies of their friends and bury them, and later returned to track down and free Lucy, where they managed to avoid detection.[^1] It scared them deeply, and they never got their revenge.[^3]

The Dracolich was dispelled and killed by [[Asmodeus]] shortly before the longest night.[^4]
