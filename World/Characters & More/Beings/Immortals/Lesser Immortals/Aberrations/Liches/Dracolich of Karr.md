The Dracolich of Karr is one of the most feared creatures in the underdark. It is said that those who cross its path are doomed to suffer a terrible fate, and many adventurers have met their end at its hands. It was created to guard [[Vecna]]'s left hand.

It made an alliance with [[Bechel of Bharam]], giving her slaves and prisoners from his take, but would not suffer her to come near the hand. 

The creature is massive in size, with dark scales and a wingspan that rivals that of an eagle. It has razor-sharp claws and teeth that can tear through armor like paper. Its eyes are a deep red color, glowing fiercely like embers in a fire. It is said that its screech echoes through the underdark for miles, sending shivers down the spines of all who hear it.

In addition to its incredible power, the Dracolich of Karr is also known for its intelligence and cunning. It is able to anticipate the actions of its enemies before they even think them, and can adapt quickly to any situation. This makes it one of the most challenging creatures to face in the underdark.

[[Miyatol Dodonus]] sensed a dark presense while in the caves of Karr, and gathered his friends [[Daedroy]], [[Tyko]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], to fight it.

It killed [[Daedroy]] and [[Tyko]], as well as enslaved [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]]. During this time it also took the [[Oathbow]] from Richard. Richard and Miyatol were forced to flee. They were able to take the bodies of their friends and bury them, and later returned to track down and free Lucy, where they managed to avoid detection. It scared them deeply, and they never got their revenge.
