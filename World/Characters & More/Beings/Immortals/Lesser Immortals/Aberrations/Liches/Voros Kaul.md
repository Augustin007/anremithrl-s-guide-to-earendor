Voros Kaul was a powerful necromancer who made a pact with Tharizdun to raise an army of undead during the [[Aetate Foedus War]]. His army of undead was the greatest that was ever seen numbers of undead, and he used this power to launch a surprise attack on the Nerosean encampment in the battle of the Aetate Foedus. After the battle, he was exiled to a deserted island and trapped there by powerful wards set up by [[Methunroa]] and [[Richard Iwaelfhem|Richard]].

His pact gave him immortality and he decided to mostly stay in the island to continue his experiments with necromancy. Richard came to the island to check on him a few times, and granted him some equipment, though Richard never forgave him for the attack on the encampment which killed his friend [[Stoic Vanem]].[^1]

[[Xandred Valerius]] learned necromancy from him after following Richard in secret, and used Voros's research to aid his own and become a lich.[^2]

Richard would take [[Sebastian De Clairmont|Sebastian Valerious]] to Voros at Xandred's suggestion so that Voros could teach Sebastian the necromancy necessary to summon the spirit of [[Baeor Dechaius|Baeor]] at the trial of Thorondor.[^2]

He would meet [[Kas]] at one point when Kas was seeking a solution to [[Ashdilkir]]'s curse. He was unable to solve Ashdilkir's problem without granting her godhood, and refused to help her ascend to godhood. He attempted to steal the fragment of [[The Forgotten One]] from them, but failed.

Ashdilkir approached him again years later with an offer that he join the [[Den]] and help her become Ashariel. He refused. For this reason, she used the The Doors to orchestrate his death, dropping [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] and [[Nil'ge'tar Remshi'ul]] on his island along with the [[Labyrinth Stone]] and affecting his mind with a curse to see everyone as enemies. He was killed and his soul absorbed into the stone.[^3]

[[Tahlia Tormund]] took his soul out of the stone when she met with [[William Treaty]] at the NAF alliance meeting, and traded his soul back to Ashdilkir in exchange for the location of the Oathbreaker Sword.[^4]

Ashdilkir resurrected as a Lich and kept his phylactery hostage. He agreed to help her ascend and ran a number of experiments with captured slaves until he accomplished his goal.[^5]

After [[Tormac]]'s destruction of [[Azerim]]. Voros began rebuilding an undead army by resurrecting everyone who had died in the city.[^6]

He succeeded in ascending Ashariel before the Longest Night.[^4][^6]
