Kas was born in [[Torin]] pre-sundering war. He became a warlock and leuitenent of [[Vecna]]. He often regretted his choice to make himself beholden to Vecna. In order to escape his vow, he killed himself and jettisoned his soul through the dark regions with spells of protections, turning himself into a Vampire, then pretended to still side with Vecna until the moment was right and betrayed him, and from then aided the fight against him, striking the final blow using his own sword. When the group split the pieces of Vecna, he hid his piece, Vecna's heart, deep in a part the [[Underdark]] which was far beneath what would one day become [[Bremen]].

He hid another one of the pieces in the Dark Regions, and his time there converted him into the first vampire.

Kas became the ruler of the city of [[Tovag]], until it's destruction in the war against the city of [[Oerth]], which was ruled by the cult of Vecna.

Kas is known to have authored _Legendry of Great Arms and Fabulous Heroes_.

He vowed to never again place himself in an unbreakable vow.

He met and fell in love with [[Ashdilkir]].

He had a pair of twins with Ashdilkir, [[Scathatch]] and [[Aeoife]]

He eventually gave the location of the heart to [[Ashdilkir]], believing her a more worthy guard than his own defenses, and helped her build her library at its entrance, and aided her in forming the [[Den]], as well as driving [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] away.

He ruled much of Bremen in secret.

He often checked the other pieces, making sure they hadn't been used.

He woke up one day hearing [[Tartarus]]'s voice in his ears, warning him one of the pieces had been stolen. Kas tracked down the left arm to [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]], and fought him, accidentally allowing [[Tahlia Tormund]] to get the eye.[^1]

He became concerned with [[Asmodeus]]'s doings and hired his daughter Aeoife to infiltrate the NAF and spy on Asmodeus.[^2]

When she was captured by the [[DragonArrow]] Company, he spoke to Ashdilkir to help rescue their daughter, and helped her ascend to Ashariel. During [[The Shattering]], he was pushed through the Conduit and thrown out of time itself by [[Ghalen]].[^2]
