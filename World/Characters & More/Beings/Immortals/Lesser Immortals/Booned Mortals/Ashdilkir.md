Born eighteen years before the end of the Sundering War, to the Devaali people, she grew up knowing a land fraught with strife and destruction. She was raised to hate the gods, on all sides of this war, for causing the great cataclysms and desolations. Magic was seen as a bad thing, and children who exhibited any signs of magic and psionics were stoned. Ashdilkir showed signs of magic when she was little, but her parents forced her to hide it, beating her when she couldn't, hoping to save her life. She spent most of her time away from the village, in the woods.

When she was nine, there was a great battle that occurred nearby, and a bright light shone in the woods. She followed it and she met the Lady of Pain in a crater, shortly after the Lady's battle with Tartarus, at the height of her Pain. Tartarus had cursed her as he was trapped, siphoning off all light and happiness from the Lady, forcing onto her pain and insanity, fragmenting her mind. If Tartarus's spell had finished taking hold it would have killed the goddess.

As the Ashdilkir came near, the goddess shifted part of the curse onto her, preventing her own death, and disappeared. Ashdilkir picked up a gem she found in the crater, and her father had it set into a necklace for her, and was going to give it to her when he eventually married her off.

When she was eleven, a group of raiders struck at her village, and she was captured. 

Her father began talking to the necklace, the only thing left of her, as he hoped for her return. The necklace, with Tartarus inside, spoke back.

She was abused and harmed until the repressed magic spilled out in the form of an Obscurus, killing everyone around her. She returned to her people without an explanation. Many of them wanted to kill her, claiming she had to be a witch for surviving. She saw it as if she had done something very bad, by using magic, and hated herself for killing the raiders.

Three years later, as the last of the betrayer gods were being sealed away, one of them, Auril, created a great storm to ravage the lands as a final act of destruction. It passed over Ashdilkir's village, and she spent her life force and magic to save her people, and died.

But in the gem, Tartarus was being driven insane by the chaos. He spoke to the father and offered a deal. Tartarus would grant one wish in exchange for the father's sanity. Tartarus saved the girl, and the father lost his mind and died soon thereafter.

She had not wanted to live. The people hated her and feared her for being magic, and her parents were gone. She tried to kill herself, again and again, to escape her village, and town, but the magic was too strong.

She fled. She spent the next century in a cave, coming out as little as she could, killing anyone who found her, hating the world and herself, feeling the eternal pain of hunger, sleeping for weeks, months, with fevers and dreams, not knowing the war of the gods was over. At first she would leave every few days, then every few weeks, then months. By the end, she had not left in years. People avoided the region, for it was too dangerous.

Over five thousand years, she lost everyone she loved. Her mind deteriorated, she slowly became more and more insane, and her mind could not deal with the amount of memories she had to store. She took new identities, forgetting her own immortality. She did good, and she did evil. Around her neck she wore the necklace, she spoke to Tartarus, but never gave him her sanity. And sometimes she thought he was her friend, bonded by hatred to the gods, but other times she hated him, and knew him to be evil. She never freed him, and she blamed him for what happened to her father. The two connived and planned for long against the gods.

She travelled through other planes, where time flowed differently, once, she spent a hundred thousand years trapped in a demiplane whilst only weeks past in the material plane, learning new things.

Practicing skills for thousands of years.

She kept diaries through it all, trying to salvage her deteriorating memory. Things she wished to forget, evil things she did, beautiful things she lost, she would rip out. 

She met Ghalen, the Chronomancer, who told her that she would be the last thing that remained at the end of Time.

Marethyu offered to restore her mind once, but she refused his price.

In the end, she went mad in her own library. Eternally reading her own diaries. Trying to figure out who she was. Calling herself only "me". Blaming the gods.

She met and fell in love with Kas, having with him a pair of twins. When Kas eventually began ruling Bremen, he built for her a great library for her to keep her memories, and brought her many gifts. Among these was a shard of The Forgotten One's divinity, which she used to try to ascend, but was unable to complete the ascension.

They created the [[Den]], a sect of their followers who helped enforce their will on the city of Bremen.

Kas and Ashdilkir slowly grew apart as Ashdilkir's sanity slowly decayed. Kas kept his distance, seeking for a cure for his love.

The [[Den]] was eventually destroyed by [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] and [[Miyatol Dodonus]]. Kas rescued Ashdilkir from them, and she was shortly able to kill Miyatol.

Asmodeus eventually approached her, offering to restore her memory in exchange for a favour. Stealing Colossus's spellbook, and delivering them seperately to the Tree. 

She hates Asmodeus, but retains loyalty to him, for her own ends. She has her own plans and schemes. Even if her memory is fixed, she now remembers everything, including the things she tried to forget. She is bitter with loss, burdened with her own evil and all the beauty and good torn away from her. 

She knows Asmodeus cannot kill her, nor can anyone. She knows pain never ends. She is not afraid. She knows no goodness ever lasts forever (nothing does), so she has decided it doesn't matter. She cannot escape torture, pain, and suffering. She only wants to wreak vengeance upon the world for this, to inflict this pain onto everyone else too. Gods, who she hates for causing the pain, and mortals, who she hates for being able to escape it. Only the lesser immortals would she spare, for she has no anger with them. They are like her in one regard. Powerless against the gods, but unable to escape. But she holds little more than apathy for them. She cares only for herself. She wants the power to turn against the gods.

In service of this, she asked in secret something of Korvos, the Necromancer. She demanded he turn her into a quasi-deity, to bind to her the powers to destroy the gods. When he refused her (For in general he thought it unwise to make someone more powerful than he, and because he doubted his ability to do this safely, without great harm to himself, or he would have done it to himself long ago), she orchestrated his death at the hands of Nugget and Tal'berius and trapped his soul the Labyrinth-stone.

Tartarus at this point slipped out of her grasp, Tartarus hoping for a new owner that might release him, who might aid his plans, and forcing himself into the grasp of Nil'ge'tar Remshi. In this way, her plan was delayed, as Korvos, in the stone, was out of her reach.

Three years later, Tahlia Tormund was able to touch the Labyrinth stone when she came across William Treaty at the NAF alliance meeting. She was able to take the soul and traded it back to Ashdilkir in exchange for the location of the Oathbreaker Sword. Ashildir resurected Korvos as a Lich, keeping his phylanctary. He bent to her will. Grateful, she traded captives, gold, and equipment to him for his experiments in return for her favour.

Right before the longest night, Korvos, combined with her vast library of knowledge and wealth, was able to complete her ascension into Ashariel. Korvos built in a weakness, a way to kill her, and secretly informed Kas of her plans. Kas was troubled. When Ashariel killed one of their children during the events of the Shattering, Kas attempted to kill Ashariel. Ghalen the Chronomancer entered time to stop Kas, Kas recognises his own face in Ghalen, and when the Conduit was formed, and Kas gained the knowledge of chronomancy, forcibly ejected from time and space, becoming Ghalen, Ashariel chases after him.
