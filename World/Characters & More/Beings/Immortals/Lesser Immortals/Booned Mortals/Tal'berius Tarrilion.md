Tal'berius was born of Tar'Daroth'ul Magnar'illion, thiry years before the sundering war, and is known as Tar'illion. He was the son of [[Magnar]]. His brother, [[Artorius]] and he were both geniuses and powerful sorcerers, and were sent to study under [[Rondar]], and quickly outpaced Rondar's existing apprentice, [[Garrett]] until he quit. Twelve years before the Sundering War, he and his brother published the [[Codex Arcanum]].

The pair allied themselves with Singollo and fought on behalf of the mortals. 

The god [[Vecna]] was split into pieces by Tal'berius, Singollo, Glorfindiel, Elian, The Raven Queen, Vistani, Artorius, and Vecna's own leuitennant Kas.  Each hid their piece in a different dungeon of their own creation, promising never to unify them. Vistani died in this battle. 

Kas and Tal'berius became good friends in this time.

~200 BS Artorius died fighting [[Tharizdun]], and Tal'berius in his anger, caused a cataclysmic rip in the weave that nearly destroyed the universe, which he was able to use to cut out the heart of the god and chain it down. This rip allowed pure Chaos through, which Tal'berius contained in the [[Orb of Annihilation]]. It also caused the destruction of the entire region, which would soon be called the Shattered Teeth. This would also be one of the major turning points in the war.

Tal'berius and [[Dallion]] became loose friends during this time.

After Artorius's death, [[Fangrim]] and Tal'berius create the first constructs.

Tal'berius fought and drove away [[Korvus]] with the aid of [[Shyvana]], stealing from Shyvana certain artifacts which he would study, earning her anger. When she came, demanding them back, he gave them back, having understood everything there was to them, and created his own. She tried to kill him, afterwards, but he killed her instead.

Tal'berius also earned the enmity of [[Tiberon]] and [[Rowena]], hunting artifacts on his own to keep for himself.

Falledric steals the [[Orb of Annihilation]] from him, and Tal'berius is unable to recapture it.

He was hired as Architect Arcane by his nephew when the city of Westhaven was founded as a sanctuary during the Sundered War.

He devoted his life to study and during the age of shadows created walls powerful enough to keep even the gods out. He built his [[Architect's Sanctum]] in Illion's old lair, right at the intersection of Ley Lines, which he studied intensly.

He grew tired of having to stop to eat and sleep and creates an elixer powerful enough to rid him of these concerns. 

He discovered the method of cloning himself, and transmitting memories and such through them. Keeping his soul bound to one body unless it died, in which he could transmit it to the next. He taught this to [[Theriad Keladri]]

He worked with [[Theriad Keladri]] for a long time in developing ideas of type theory and category theory. 

He designed early Taxblades.

He eventually sook out [[Davros]]. Together, the two designed the final Taxblades.

When Auril eventually broke through the walls of Westhaven, he ignored her, as she could not get into the lair itself, and shortly reinstated the spells, stronger than before.

He tracked down [[Ashdilkir]] and with [[Miyatol Dodonus]]'s help was able to take care of most of her [[Den]], but he was driven away by his fomer friend Kas.  

He regained the Orb of Annhilation, bypassing the teleportation block, and trying to avoid the attention of more powerful magic users, by using the [[Echoes of Divinity]] ship and crew to get to Othron Ibrith, and kills Falledric.

He hired them again for dealing with Ashdilkir, but failed to obtain the stone. Nearly dying when Ashdilkir bests him and kills his clone, as well as losing two taxblades, prompting him to realise that his mechanical bodyguards have not been updated in centuries and have fallen far from modern capabilities.

He was at the Tree of Sanctuary during the Confrontation and cut of a branch of it using a remnant from on of the [[Epic Dragons]]. 

He sacrificed his hand to answer certain questions he has about the tree, and was thus able to construct the Astral Leywrite. It did not work at the time because of Atropus's damage to the structure of the planes.

When he discovered the Second Rift, he attempted to rebind it as he did before, but Chaos is more powerful than it used to be. In the end, in desparation, he traveled and obtained Vecna's hand, and replaced his missing hand with it. He uses Vecna's power to contain the Chaos.

He advised Gallio to give up Aldarkeep pass.

He agreed to fight in the longest night when he speaks to William Treaty.

[[Tahlia Tormund]] stole the Eye of Vecna from his vault during this time. 

After Ashdilkir ascended, Tal'berius spoke with Kas again, rekindling their old friendship for the first time, and advised him that Ashdilkir may be beyond saving.

The hand disappeared after Vecna's destruction. 

At the Shattering, Tal'berius absorbed the Tree after Colossus destroyed it becoming the origin of the Ley Lines. He redirected Auril's divinity (and thus Dur'bagaal's remnant) and formed the Conduit.
