Copy-pasted from character sheet. Not D&D 5e intially, but ported over at one point

Theriad is a warlock patron and quasi-deity. Theriad is just low level enough to squeeze through the tree of names with great cost, it leaves him greatly exhausted, and dispels any magic active on him, so he does not travel through much, but choses instead to stay in his primary personal demiplane. 

in his life. Theriad built a great library named lorekeep on the material plane, it is the only public library currently in existance, and the librarians of lorekeep are all warlocks that have him as their patron. 
From the end of his original campaign: "He was once the chosen champion and servant of the god of knowledge, though now he has superceded that, becoming closer to his right-hand man."

My personal Demiplanes.
Demiplane 1:
Contains many clones of me. 
Permanenced Teleportation circle.
Filled with five hundred of glyphs of warding charged with magic missile and five ninth level counterspells to prevent shield, in five phases, that can be activated when I give the word, or if anyone attacks me or any of my clones while in the demiplane.
The clones have Glyph of Warding with the twenty contingency spells so that on awakening they already have it.
The ground here has been permanently hallowed, forbiddanced, and cloistered. No one can get in without my permission.

Demiplane 2:
Large mansion with a Bed, and a chest (bigger on the inside) filled with coins and other magic items, outside is magical plains, where my dogs, horses, cats, goats, and other animals live. There is a farm and a forest mantained by a staff of permanenced unseen servants. There is a room with a permananced ninth-level teleportation circle (9th level ones can travel between planes and are automatically permanent, but only from other 9th level circles) it is locked and personal. I have linking locked permananced circles on a personal demiplane connected to each major plane I've been to.
Filled with five hundred of glyphs of warding charged with magic missile and five ninth level counterspells to prevent shield, in five phases, that can be activated when I give the word, or if anyone attacks me or any of my clones while in the demiplane.
The ground here has been permanently hallowed, forbiddanced, and cloistered. No one can get in without my permission.

Demiplane 3:
Permanenced Teleportation circle, locked and stuff, like the rest.
Filled with 8000 prison cells, with permanent antimagic permeating the entire prison. The antimagic in each cell can only be dispelled by me, and makes an exception for my own casting, on each cell. The locks for the doors are doubled. Both mundane
Filled with five hundred of glyphs of warding charged with magic missile and five ninth level counterspells to prevent shield, in five phases, that can be activated when I give the word, or if anyone attacks me or any of my clones while in the demiplane.
The ground here has been permanently hallowed and cloistered. No one can get in without my permission. Originally four clones continuously work on creating more cells. They clone themselves, every now and then, so now there are many, many more.
Permananced unseen servants exist for each cell, and generation spells automatically summon food. 
Permanenced Teleportation circle.
Filled with five hundred of glyphs of warding charged with magic missile and five ninth level counterspells to prevent shield, in five phases, that can be activated when I give the word, or if anyone attacks me or any of my clones while in the demiplane.
The ground here has been permanently hallowed, forbiddanced, and cloistered. No one can get in without my permission.

Demiplane 4
The great forge: Clones of me creat magic items. They can wake up clones in the clone storage room if they are clones of a too outdated part of me.
Permanenced Teleportation circle.
Filled with five hundred of glyphs of warding charged with magic missile and five ninth level counterspells to prevent shield, in five phases, that can be activated when I give the word, or if anyone attacks me or any of my clones while in the demiplane.
The ground here has been permanently hallowed, forbiddanced, and cloistered. No one can get in without my permission.

Standard Demiplane Setup.
I create the demiplane, cast clone. The clone of me sets it up, and, when completed, teleports to the clone demiplane and stays there.

The way clones work is that the original has to maintain control of all of them, and having too many clones would cause paralysis. But to prevent this, all of the clones are under a permanent sleep spell, and controlled instead by a permanent unseen servant, which is undone if my soul is transfered there. If any of the unseen servants are dismissed, or anything else goes wrong, the permanent sleep spell is reactivated, and another clone is tasked with fixing the problem.
