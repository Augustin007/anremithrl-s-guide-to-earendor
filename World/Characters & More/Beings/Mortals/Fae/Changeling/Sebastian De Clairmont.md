Common Name: Sebastian “Zee“ Valerious 

Real Name: Sebastian De Clairmont

  

A serious and intelligent yet chaotic student of the Mysthaven College of Magic. Adopted son of the Dean of Necromancy who was put on probation for various unapproved magic experiments as well as various political stunts on campus. Not that he really ascribes to any particular ideology except that he believes in absolute freedom as well as particular disregard status of the noble families of Neros. Current spending his time avoiding his father’s wrath dues to his antics.

As a child his mother’s death revealed her status as a changeling so his father Lord Seigmund De Clairmont spent and incredible sum of money to find out if any of his children were changelings as well. Upon finding out his youngest son was in fact a changeling just like his wife he cast him out intending for him to die in city with no skills to his name, but he survived just enough to be found by the man he would come to see as his true father, the undying lich Xandred Valerious. 

An accomplished scholar in a variety of fields both magical and nonmagical, Xandred recognized the vicious untrusting changeling for what he was, an abandoned lonely child. So he took him under his wing, teaching him a variety of magics and even imparting some of his own power onto the boy. They traveled for a good while until the boy started too mature before they settled down at Mysthaven College where Xandred had previously taught and had many compatriots among the faculty.
