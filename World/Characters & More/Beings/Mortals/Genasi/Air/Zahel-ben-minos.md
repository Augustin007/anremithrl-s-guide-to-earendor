Zahel is a member of the house of Craet, a powerful aristocratic house known for its magical abilities and penchant for consulting with creatures of the elemental planes. However, he and his immediate family are estranged from the current head of the house, Cael ben Aretas, who cut off his grandson Minos for refusing to participate in an arranged marriage to advance the house’s position and for consulting with the Djinn. However, although Zahel reaps no benefits from his aristocratic roots, he remains in contact with the Djinn Tycha, from whom his branch of the house of Craet derive their genasi roots. Although she is inconsistent and flighty, her gifts have nevertheless been a matter of life and death at times in the uncertain, gilded age of Imperial Neros. Among them is Zahel’s pet rock dove (pigeon) Theodorus (Theo), whose elemental gifts include increased intelligence and discerning taste in where to relieve himself. 

Often uses his friend Helena's position in the department of Information to obtain leads, to her consternation.

He also often speaks with Sebastian Valerius.

Important notes: the house of Craet is well-known for its elemental consultations, and Zahel’s branch, descended from the inconsistent but generally benevolent Djinn, is not held in high favor. Cael ben Aretas is well known for his pacts with the Dao Olm, whereas the descendants of Tycha often ally instead with the warlocks or sorcerers aligned with the Marid. In a gilded age, the accumulation of wealth is valued more highly than a rejection of cruelty, and so at this time pacts with the Dao remain quite popular among the house of Craet.  

While Craet is considered a noble house in its own right, it’s more useful to frame it as a social and cultural vehicle by which mortals make contact with the Elemental planes, at least in Neros. As such, it monopolizes contact with the various types of Genies, and retains the power to undermine or impoverish its members who do not toe the line of the house leaders.
