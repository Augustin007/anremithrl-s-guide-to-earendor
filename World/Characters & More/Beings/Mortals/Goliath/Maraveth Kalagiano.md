Maraveth Kalagiano was the firstborn daughter of king [[Ilikan Kalagiano]] and Queen [[Auerathne]]. 

Her father, King Ilikan Kalagiano, was famed for his discipline and his towering presence in Solenthiri politics, a ruthless man who saw diplomacy as war by slower means. Her mother, Queen Auerathne, was a scholar of lineage and law, instilling in Maraveth a deep knowledge of dynastic politics, heraldry, and the precise ceremonial etiquette for which Solenthir was renowned.

From a young age, Maraveth was trained as both a diplomat and a commander’s daughter—well-versed in the great military campaigns of the Age of Heroes, drilled in the public performances expected of royal women, and taught to navigate the rivalries of court life with both steel and silk.

Despite initial hostility, Maraveth proved a capable queen. She learned the Drakenthorne dialect fluently within two years and took personal interest in the organization of the palace household, reshaping it with Solenthiri precision. She became a mediator between the often prideful dragonborn lords and the more pragmatic Valthor, tempering disputes before they could ignite.

Her reign was marked by tireless work in fostering cultural exchange—she invited Solenthiri scholars to Drakenthorne’s libraries, introduced new systems of military supply management, and even sponsored the construction of a diplomatic quarter in the capital to host foreign envoys.

But her marriage to Valthor was cool, more a partnership of political necessity than deep affection. The Dragonking’s attentions often wandered to his campaigns and to his vision of passing his draconic blessing to the next generation.

Maraveth bore Valthor five children, [[Kae'dros'vro'tha'ne Remshi'ul]], [[Madhra'vel'thyn Remshi'il]], [[Ot'vith'drin'tar Remshi'ul]], [[Sa'reth'vro'drel Remshi'il]], [[Vel'arra'ka'veth'tar Remshi'il]].

By the last decade of her life, grief had begun to weigh heavily on Maraveth. Of her five children, only Vel’arra still lived; the rest had been claimed by war, politics, and treachery. Her influence at court began to wane as Valthor’s attention shifted toward his later alliances and the grooming of distant Remshi kin to secure the line.

Her final years were marked by increasing seclusion. She spent much of her time in the Queen’s Solar, writing long letters to Vel’arra and overseeing the education of her grandchildren. She died quietly in 4780 AS, reportedly from an illness of the lungs.
