Iskandar, also known as King Iskandar the Wise or simply "The Wise",  was a ruler of the [[Chiss Empire]] known for his wisdom and magical abilities. 

He was born to a noble family and became a powerful wizard at an early age. He gained notoriety by defeating many powerful enemies, including the dragon [[Kragloth]].

In addition to his magical abilities, Iskandar was also known for his wisdom. He had a deep understanding of the world around him and often used his knowledge to guide others. His advice and counsel were sought after by many, including kings and queens, as he possessed a unique perspective on the political situation in Earendor.

Iskandar's most notable achievement was the compilation of the [[Tome of Silence]], which contained the secrets of all known spells.

When [[Shar]]'s disciples attempted to destroy his kingdom, he took upon a curse in order to stop them. This curse began killing him slowly and painfully.

Realizing he had failed as a father to [[Hechilspet]], who had become arrogant and self-serving, hid it from his son in the [[Caverns of Stillness]], ordering one of his advisors to reveal it to Hechilspet once he matured. This day never came.
