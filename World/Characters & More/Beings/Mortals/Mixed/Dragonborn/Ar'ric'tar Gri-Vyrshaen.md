Ar'ric'tar Gri-Vyrshaen, known as Ar'ric. Was the decendent of the dragon Rahsauri. He was the king of Xirdakul since the death of the Dragon, until his death in the year 5420 AS.

He had a particular hatred of Drizzt Rashauri.

He wished to take the lands he had promised to Lord Drizzt Rashauri and Lady Lirien Rashauri, and Drizzt raised a small rebellion against him.

In the great meeting of the NAF, [[Bechel of Bharam]] spoke to him, turning him against his allies, seeing them as enemies, and Aric swore himself to [[Tartarus]] and killed [[Bressus Stonefist]]. He died at the hands of [[Alantothi]] during the meeting.
