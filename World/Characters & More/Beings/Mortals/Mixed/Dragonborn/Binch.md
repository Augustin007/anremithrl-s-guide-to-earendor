Binch grew up in the slums of Carahadras, stealing food and small goods to survive. Though he was a thief, he sought companionship as much as coin. He gained a reputation as both scoundrel and storyteller, sometimes giving away what he stole to earn trust.

During Auril’s blizzard he survived by looting the dead, taking rings, purses, and other valuables from frozen corpses. He sold some, and gave others away. Quick and resourceful, he lived by his wits.

He met Ahktos while scavenging a ruined village, later clashing with Naras. After some discussion, he buys horses for the party in exchange for keeping what Ahktos had scavenged. He goes on to die fighting Voren in the subsequent skirmish.
