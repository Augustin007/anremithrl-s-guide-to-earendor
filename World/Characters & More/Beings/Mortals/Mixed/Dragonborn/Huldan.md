Huldan was a solitary druid who found greater comfort in the company of wolves, hawks, and trees than in the presence of men. He wandered the forests of Golin, tending to wounded beasts and whispering to streams. Those few who knew him thought him strange but harmless, a figure glimpsed at the edges of villages before fading back into the wild.

When Auril’s eternal blizzard swept over Foedus, Huldan was unable to keep foraging, and eventually starved to death.
