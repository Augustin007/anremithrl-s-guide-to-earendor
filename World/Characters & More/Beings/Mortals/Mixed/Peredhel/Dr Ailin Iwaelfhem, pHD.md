(And his brother, )
Descended of Oracus's own Sir Richard Iwaelfhem. 
Ailin was born six years before his brother, [[Richard Iwaelfhem (Younger)]], in the year 5376, in Dragonvale, Swanward. He and his brother lived under the lordship of William III Dragonvale. They were very close.
He began studying Arcana and Artifice in the Silverlight College, and became rather fond of smithing, but pivoted to Mathematics when he turned out to be a drab (unable to channel magic), though he kept some knowledge about runes. 
He fell in love with and married a Leq'er woman named Taya, but she left him before he completed his pHD.
He finished his pHD in mathematics in the year 5400 AS. 
His longer Peredhel life, being longer than the humans around him, and his knowledge of runes and planes, allowed him to realise a particular way to gain wealth to continue to fund his research, by creating sufficiently aged wines. He established a brewery in 5402 AS, his knowledge of runes allowed him to make a small temporal planar barrier in the cellar, so that his wines would age faster.
In 5421 he was in Izar along with his brother. 

[
TO THE DM: I'll leave to your discretion the later details, potentially including why he would leave to Izar (presumably for his studies), and take his brother with him. And why his brother has such a poweful divine springwell of magic in him, and whether that is related. And how they ended up without their memories in the forest.

Nothing is really off-limits with the story, including any open ends such as what happened to the brewery, or with Taya.
