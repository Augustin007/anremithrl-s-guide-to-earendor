Kaelith Musaed was always meant to excel.

He had photographic memory. He had taught himself how to read when he was two.

He was the son of Dorian Musaed, one of the most respected scholars of the Chiss Empire, who had moved to Veloria to have better opportunities for his brilliant son. 

Kaelith was burdened with expectation at every moment. He absorbed knowledge at a rapid pace, surpassing his tutors and moving quickly into advanced arcane theory. He had little patience for those who could not keep up, and a deep-seated belief that intelligence was the only true measure of worth.

By the age of ten, he was reading treatises on planar convergence and magical energy transfer. By fifteen, he had already written and published his first paper.

Soon after being accepted into the colleges, vorascious with knowledge, and believing himself better than the others, Kaelith broke into the restricted archives of the colleges, trying to read up on forbidden magic. Magic too dangerous or unethical to try. 

He attempted some of these rituals, and was discovered. He was dragged before the archmages and expelled in disgrace.

For a year, Kaelith wandered. He sought knowledge in less reputable circles—smugglers, black-market arcanists, even cultists who worshipped long-forgotten gods. He honed his magic, experimented with necrotic energy, and continued to chase the most secret and hidden knowledge.

His wandering led him to the Chiss Empire.

It was during this time that he encountered the Sol’karis.

Kaelith lied about his past when he applied.

He presented himself as a simple researcher, curious but loyal, never mentioning his expulsion or his previous studies. His intelligence impressed the scholars, and he was accepted into the order.

For the next three years, he played the role of the diligent scholar, gaining trust, subtly guiding research projects, and manipulating others to help him uncover ancient knowledge.

In 5417 AS, Kaelith encountered Xalvor Asheil, a young diviner obsessed with an approaching darkness in the weave of fate. Xalvor's mentor had died recently, and Kaelith saw in him a useful pawn—a brilliant but emotionally vulnerable mage who could be steered toward the research Kaelith needed.

The two spent long hours poring over celestial anomalies, magical disturbances, and prophecies that spoke of ancient gods awakening.

When Xalvor uncovered the first traces of Hechilspet's surviving cult, Kaelith was the first to encourage him to investigate further. He knew the name Hechilspet well—one of the first mortal mages to successfully steal divine power, and created some of the very rituals that lay in the forbidden halls.

When the Sol’karis formed a team to infiltrate the cult, Kaelith volunteered immediately.
