Tahlia Tormund was born of Lilith Tormund, who was the daughter of [[Asmodeus]] and Nemi Tormund, a mortal who was seduced by Azmodeus during [[The Sundered War]].

Tahlia was born in the year 4618 AA. 

She served her grandfather Asmodeus, and he helped her take the throne of Karr in the summer of the year 4639 AA with the aid of [[Bechel of Bharam]]. When Bechel betrayed Asmodeus in the winter of the next year, Tahlia chased after her into the nine hells, and Bechel captured her. 

Bechel kept her there sustaining her life by siphoning off Thalia's immortality, and protecting herself from the torture of the nine hells by stealing Asmodeus's protection over Thalia. This endured until Bechel was given the Sight by [[Marethyu]], 

Thalia was driven insane by her time in the nine hells. She avoided her grandfather, who would have killed he for failing him, and made her way through the nine hells without the protection of her grandfather. 

One time, she came dangerously close to the Abyss, and could hear Shar's voice.

She escaped the nine hells in the year 4815, and remained insane for another century until [[Eleutheros]] took pity on her and restored her mind.

Karr had long been gone, except pockets that remained in the north, but she reconquered the land where the great cities of Karr used to be and named it the Rymfel, and it is known now as Kar-Rymfel.

She allied again with her grandfather when he slipped through the Tree of Names, eager for a new chance to prove herself.

In the year 5421 AS, she stole the eye of [[Vecna]] from [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]]. She attempted to use it to defeat Bechel. When this failed, and she again attempted to enlist the help of [[William Treaty]], he killed her with his distancer.
