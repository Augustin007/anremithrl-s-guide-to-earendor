The Celestial Council is an organization that comprises the twelve celestial gods who were born before the Eternal Wars. They are regarded as the highest authority.

The Celestial Council convenes regularly to discuss matters of cosmic importance and shape the fate of the universe. It is responsible for creating the [[Greater Council]], which consists of both the Celestials and later-born gods who were born before the end of the Eternal Wars. The council also oversees the Senate of the gods.

The Celestial Council's meetings are often held at the [[Grand Conclave]] in [[Arvandor]], the realm they created for themselves as a safe haven from the conflicts of the world. The council has a strong focus on preserving balance in the universe and preventing any being or entity that poses a threat to it.

It was here that the most powerful of the Celestials, [[Thalorin]] spoke against the council.

In the [[Halls of Justice]], [[Asmodeus]] declared his treason, and Thalorin spoke against him.

The Celestial council no longer includes all twelve, since after the Sundering war, the righteous council was exiled and the betrayer gods were also exiled.
