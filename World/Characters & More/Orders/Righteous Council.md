The Righteous Council is a group of gods who were exiled from Arvandor during the Sundering War. They crafted The Seven Heavens in the quasi-plane situated between the Material Plane and the distant Elysium, where they dwelt forever separated from their original divine abode. After [[Tyr]] helped them defeat Orcus at the end of the war, he was accepted as one of their own.
The Righteous Council is often seen as a group of good gods. They believe in the principles of justice, honor, and fairness.
The original righteous council consisted of [[Thalorin]], it's head, and his siblings [[Varian]], and [[Elandra]]. They were the three who broke away from the Celestial council, and though they were weakened and eternally exiled from Arvandor, they fought to protect mortals from the [[Betrayer Gods]].

By the end of the Sundering War, Vairan and Elandra had fallen. Thalorin did obtain the aid of [[Nebelum]] and [[Hekate]], as well as [[Tyr]] and [[Araushnee]].

Righteous Council:
1. [[Thalorin]]
2. [[Tyr]] (Technically not a celestial)
3. [[Araushnee]] (Technically not a celestial)
4. [[Nebelum]]
5. [[Hekate]]
