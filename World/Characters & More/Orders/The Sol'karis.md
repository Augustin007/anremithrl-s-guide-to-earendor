# The Sol’karis: The Wandering Order of Magic and Mercy  

### Origins and Purpose  

The Sol’karis is a small but deeply respected order operating within sections of the Chiss Empire. Originally founded as a haven for persecuted mages, the order has evolved into a loose collection of scholars, healers, and wanderers who seek to balance knowledge with service. The government of the Chiss Empire recognizes the order’s neutrality, granting them exemption from taxes and respecting their role as an asylum for those seeking refuge from magical persecution.  

Though never particularly wealthy or powerful, the Sol’karis has endured for centuries, not through force or conquest but by offering guidance, wisdom, and aid to those in need.  

### A Tradition of Balance: Knowledge and Service  

At its heart, the Sol’karis is dedicated to two principles: the pursuit of knowledge and the responsibility to use magic for the greater good. However, how that balance should be struck has always been a point of contention.  

Some members see the Sol’karis as a hall of study, meant to protect, preserve, and understand lost knowledge. Others believe the order must be actively engaged in the world, taking a direct role in helping people through healing, protection, and public works.  

This divide is not formalized into factions, but it is deeply felt.  

- The Scholars and Historians believe the greatest duty of the Sol’karis is to preserve knowledge. They see their role as archivists, researchers, and teachers, ensuring that magical history and discoveries are not lost to time. They conduct archaeological digs, translate ancient texts, and work tirelessly to document the world’s magical heritage.  
- The Wanderers and Healers believe that knowledge without action is meaningless. They travel the empire, offering magical aid to the sick, teaching rural communities basic spellcraft, and protecting travelers from bandits and magical threats. They see themselves as the living hands of the Sol’karis, ensuring that magic is a force for good, not just an intellectual pursuit.  

The two perspectives often clash, but neither side holds dominance over the order. The Sol’karis remains a gathering of individuals rather than a rigid hierarchy, bound together by shared values rather than strict doctrine.  

### Operations and Influence in the Chiss Empire  

Unlike larger magical institutions or religious orders, the Sol’karis does not wield political power or military strength. It exists at the edges of society, operating with the quiet approval of the Chiss Empire, which tolerates their presence so long as they do not interfere too greatly in affairs of state.  

The Chiss government has granted them several privileges, including:  
- Tax Exemption – The Sol’karis is not required to pay tribute or taxes to the empire.  
- Recognition of Asylum – Those who seek sanctuary within the Sol’karis halls are protected from arrest or persecution while within their walls.  
- Neutrality in Conflicts – The empire does not expect the Sol’karis to take sides in political disputes or wars, though individual members sometimes choose to act on their own convictions.  

Despite these allowances, the Sol’karis is not a major player in imperial politics. They operate in the margins of the Chiss Empire, often seen as eccentric recluses or well-meaning meddlers rather than an institution of power.  

#### Sol’karis Halls  
While many members live nomadic lives, the order does maintain a handful of modest halls scattered throughout the Chiss Empire. These halls serve as:  
- Libraries and archives for magical research.  
- Shelters for travelers and refugees seeking safety.  
- Workshops where alchemists, enchanters, and healers practice their crafts.  
- Places of learning, where young mages can study without fear of persecution.  

These halls are small, sparsely funded, and often in remote areas, relying on donations and trade to sustain themselves. While the empire permits their existence, it does not actively support them.  

#### The Wandering Sol’karis  
Many members of the Sol’karis choose to travel rather than remain in one place. These wanderers act as:  
- Mediators and healers, tending to rural communities and travelers in need.  
- Archaeologists and explorers, searching for lost knowledge and magical artifacts.  
- Defenders against rogue mages, bandits, and magical creatures.  

These wandering mages are the most visible face of the Sol’karis, often seen as folk heroes or wandering sages in the regions where they travel.  

### Reputation and Challenges  

- Some see them as harmless scholars, out of touch with the practical needs of the empire.  
- Others view them as troublemakers, interfering in matters that do not concern them.  
- More skeptical minds accuse them of hoarding knowledge, wondering what secrets they might be keeping hidden.  

The Sol’karis itself faces ongoing challenges:  
- Funding and Resources – Without state sponsorship, they struggle to maintain their halls and fund their expeditions.  
- Internal Division – The ongoing debate between study and action continues to shape the order’s future.  
- The Changing World – As technology advances and the world shifts toward firearms and mechanical innovations, magic’s place in society is changing, and the Sol’karis must adapt or risk fading into irrelevance.
