Ahktos was a gnome of Gnomes'helm. After the awakening of the gnomes, his first job was at a makeshift bakery which doubled as a front for operations of the worldwide criminal ring known as the Greenclad. While at the bakery, Ahktos earned enough to take classes at the college in Gnomes'helm. He was properly inducted into the Greenclad and carried out operations for them while continuing to study for his degree in Alchemy. When everything shut down from Auril's storms, he took on messenger jobs, allowing high-ranking officials to bribe him to read important mail. He was sent by Krag to deliver a message to King Colossus and bribed by Voren, who tampered with the mail. He got lost in the storm on his way.
