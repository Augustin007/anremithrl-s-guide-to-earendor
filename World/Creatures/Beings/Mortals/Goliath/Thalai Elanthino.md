Thalai was born in 5395 in Solenthir. When he was sixteen, he enlisted in the Solenthiri army during the desperate struggles against Auril’s encroaching forces.

He eventually was promoted by King Aukan Kalagiano into General Gallio Thunukalathi's Siegebreaker division, the most elite force in the Solenthiri army. Thalai would go on to become part of Gallio's honor guard when the NAF was formed, and Gallio became lord commander of the NAF, the single most powerful military leader in the planet.

At Chokepoint Zeta, Aldarkeep pass, desperately outnumbered and unable to get reinforcements fast enough, Gallio tried guerilla tactics, underestimating the potency of Bechel's divination. As his forces got detailed and the small groups were being slaughtered, Gallio ordered a retreat, and took a small force to hold off Bechel as long as possible. Thalai as a member of Gallio's honor guard, followed him into this stand. 

As the rest of the honor guard and the force was slaughtered, Gallio managed to carry a gravely injured Thalai to safety, the only two survivors. They traveled alone for an entire day to the fallback point in Azerim, regrouping with the retreating forces.

A goliath soldier who fought in the Siegebreaker division of the Solenthiri army. After he was shot by archers when Bechel  of Chokepoint Zero, he was rescued by High General Galio Thunukalathi,
