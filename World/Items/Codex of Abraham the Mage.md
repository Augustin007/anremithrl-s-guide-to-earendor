Codex written by Abraham the Mage containing the knowledge of the world. It was copied over by [[Korvus]]. 

It has a strange script that continuously moves and shifts, showing different knowledge at different points. It is protected by a Curse of Knowledge, which makes the user obsessed with knowledge and the book to prevent the book's destruction.

[[Liriel Danstal]] was given the book by [[Bahamut|Fizban]], and the curse began to consume her. 

She would eventually use the book to kill Auril and gain mastery over its curse.
