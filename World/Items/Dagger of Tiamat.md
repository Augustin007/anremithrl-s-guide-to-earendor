The Dagger of Tiamat is a sacred weapon that belonged to the dragon goddess [[Tiamat]] before the Sundering War. It was given to her by [[Tartarus]], but it long since became more akin to it's new master than it's old. The dagger was lost during the Sundering war when [[Tiamat]] fought her cousin [[Bahamut]].

It eventually was discovered by the dwarves.

When [[William Treaty]] found it where it was being studied, he found he could hear [[Tiamat]] whispering to him, and he took the dagger for himself. Through the dagger, Tiamat was able to influence him.

William eventually got rid of the dagger, and [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] obtained it, and kept it displayed next to the chained heart of a beating god.
