# The Flameheart

## Overview

The Flameheart appears as a luminous, heart-shaped gem, perpetually ablaze with a gentle yet powerful fire. Its hues shift, reflecting the emotions and intentions of its wielder.

The Flameheart is an ancient and powerful magic item, steeped in the history of the Sundered War and the eternal flames of the [[Undying Pyre]]. This legendary artifact, a gem of pure fire, was crafted with the aid of [[Kossuth]], the Primordial of Fire, for a mortal mage named [[Althazar the Bright|Althazar]]. The Flameheart has since passed through many hands, each bearer adding to its storied legacy, before eventually returning to the possession of Kossuth, who now guards it jealously.

## Creation

The Flameheart was born from the fiery depths of the [[Undying Pyre]], during the tumultuous times of the Sundered War. Its creation was a collaboration between Kossuth and Althazar the Bright, a half-elven mage renowned for his journey to the Plane of Fire and his dedication to protecting his people.

### Althazar's Journey
Althazar, in his quest to shield his kin from the horrors of the Sundered War, sought the power of the primordial flame. His journey led him to the heart of the [[Undying Pyre]], where he presented a specially prepared [[Firestone|firestone]] to Kossuth. This firestone, meticulously enchanted during Althazar's long pilgrimage, was imbued with intricate arcane spells capable of binding and oaths.

### The Pact with Kossuth
Kossuth, recognizing the potential in Althazar's proposal, agreed to a pact. Althazar became the first Warlock under Kossuth's patronage, pledging his service in exchange for the safety of his people. Kossuth then imbued the firestone with his own primordial essence, transforming it into the Flameheart. However, the stone's powerful enchantments resisted Kossuth's influence, inadvertently absorbing a portion of his essence.

## Properties

The Flameheart, a gem of incandescent fire, holds immense power over the elemental force of fire. It acts as a potent arcane focus, amplifying the abilities of its wielder, especially in spells of fire and destruction.

### Immortality of the Wielder
Althazar, wielding the Flameheart, was unable to die as long as he possessed it. And Hechilspet could not kill him until he had pried the flameheart out of Althazar's hands.

## History

### Era of Althazar
Althazar wielded the Flameheart to protect his people from the devastations of the Sundered War. His name became synonymous with hope and resistance against the overwhelming forces of darkness.

### Fall and Capture
Althazar's downfall came at the hands of the tyrant [[Hechilspet]], at the [[Battle of Crimson Skies]]. Hechilspet seized the Flameheart for his malevolent purposes. Under Hechilspet's rule, the Flameheart was used to spread fear and destruction until his eventual defeat by [[Eleutheros]].

### The Lost Years
After Hechilspet's fall, the Flameheart disappeared from the annals of history, its whereabouts unknown for centuries. It resurfaced briefly in the hands of a group of bandits known as [[The Amber Wings]], before passing through various owners, each leaving their mark on its legacy.

## Return to Kossuth
The Flameheart's journey came full circle when it was finally reclaimed by Kossuth. The Primordial of Fire, recognizing the significance of the artifact and its connection to his own essence, now guards it within the fiery depths of the [[Undying Pyre]].

## Significance

The Flameheart is more than a mere artifact; it is a symbol of the enduring struggle between the primordial forces and the mortal realms. Its history is a testament to the resilience of those who wield it, and a reminder of the tumultuous times from which it was born.

## Conclusion

The Flameheart remains one of the most fascinating and significant relics from the Sundered War era. Its journey through the ages, from the hands of a heroic mage to the clutches of a tyrant, and finally back to its primordial creator, is a tale that continues to inspire and caution those who study the annals of history. The Flameheart, now in the keeping of [[Kossuth]], serves as a lasting symbol of the fiery spirit that burns within all beings, mortal and divine alike.

## Creation

[[Althazar the Bright|Althazar]] was a ardwelian half-elven mage who lived in the time of the sundered war. Seeking to protect his people, he undertook a journey to the [[Undying Pyre]] to seek out Kossuth. Along the way, he picked up an ordinary [[Firestone|firestone]] and set it in his staff. His journey took years, and he spent much of the time cutting and perfecting the jewel, enchanting it with layers and layers of arcane enchantments during his journey, and when he met Kossuth, the firestone was already a powerful arcane focus for the manipulation of fire. 
It took Althazar several centuries to reach Kossuth, and he had not come to Kossuth without a plan, for he had developed spells of binding and of oaths. He showed these to Kossuth, and showed him how he could become more powerful. He could channel his power through people bound to him, people doing his will. He could extend his will and dominion over the mortals if they so agreed. And Althazar promised that if his people remained safe, he would serve Kossuth. And Althazar became the first Warlock. 
And Kossuth took the firestone and used it as a token of the pact, and he bent his own primordial magic upon it, but Althazar had made it too powerful, and the stone fought against him, and took some of his essense. And Althazar took the stone and enacted Kossuth's realm, and he protected peoples from the brimstone and hellfire of the age. 
He could not die while he held the stone, and he dwelt until the age of [[Hechilspet]]. 
Althazar became a lord under Hechilspet nearly two-thousand years after the Sundered War. He fought alongside the Warlord King. As Hechilspet rose in his power and malevolence, and his madness was more clearly shown, Althazar sought to protect people from his madness, and he fought against Hechilspet, but he was cast down and broken, and Hechilspet took from him the Flameheart, and used it for his own dark purposes. When Hechilspet fell to [[Eleutheros]], the Flameheart lay untouched in his vault until it again saw the light of day when a group of [[The Amber Wings|bandits]] took it. It passed many hands before Kossuth was able to reclaim it.
