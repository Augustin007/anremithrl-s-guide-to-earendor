The sword of Eons was crafted by [[Telos]] and [[Kossuth]] in the peace that was before the Eternal Wars. 
There had been smaller conflicts between the primordials, and Kossuth thought to arm himself, for he loved his siblings, and he sought to protect them, for if Kossuth had a fault it was an overprotective and jealous loyalty, and that fault has not yet left him.
In his mind he conceived the first weapons, or so he thought, for it was the whispers of [[Shar]] that spoke to him, and to others, though he knew it not. 
He asked of his brother [[Arambar]], to give him some of the time that he had made, and he began his work in the fountains of creation, and poured into it much power, but [[Akadi]] his sister turned him aside from the task, fearing this dangerous instrument.

Now, as the planes expanded, [[Telos]] was born in [[The Great Forges]] which bordered the [[Undying Pyre]] and [[Mechanus]], and he saw Kossuth work and he learned from his ways of creation, and Telos became a great builder and master in his own right.

Now Kossuth was unpredictable, and often tossed aside unfinished works, and Telos took them up and finished him, and Kossuth developed some affection for the lesser primordial. 

Telos took the unfinished blade to his home in The Great Forges, and he imbued it with his own power, and tuned it to perfection, and he worked on it for a long time, and when he was done he cooled it in [[The Tides of Chaos]].

And when the Eternal Wars broke out, Telos used this blade, until his body was broken, and when Nehusta his wife made him a new body she forbade he take up again the blade, and so he took it before Kossuth, and gave it to him as a great gift, and Kossuth would wield it through the eternal wars, and still wields it today.


# The Sword of Eons

## Introduction

The Sword of Eons stands as a monumental creation in the annals of cosmic history, a weapon forged in the era preceding the Eternal Wars. Its origin is intertwined with the primordial forces of creation and destruction, embodying the power and complexities of its creators, [[Kossuth]] and [[Telos]]. This document explores the intricate history and significance of the Sword of Eons, revealing its impact on the fabric of the cosmos and its role in the Eternal Wars.

## Creation and Forge

### Conception by Kossuth
The inception of the Sword of Eons was a result of Kossuth's overprotective and fiercely loyal nature. Concerned about the safety of his siblings amidst rising conflicts, Kossuth envisioned a powerful weapon. Unbeknownst to him, these thoughts were influenced by the subtle whispers of [[Shar]], weaving a thread of destiny that would resonate through time.

### Collaboration with Arambar
Kossuth approached his brother [[Arambar]], seeking a portion of the time Arambar had crafted. With this temporal essence, Kossuth began his monumental task at the [[Fountains of Creation]], pouring his fiery power into the nascent blade. However, his sister [[Akadi]] intervened, fearful of the destructive potential of such a weapon.

### Telos's Involvement
[[Telos]], emerging from the Great Forges near the [[Undying Pyre]] and [[Mechanus]], observed Kossuth's craftsmanship. Inspired and intrigued, Telos honed his skills, becoming a master creator. Often, Kossuth abandoned his unfinished creations, which Telos would then complete, fostering a bond between the two.

### The Final Forging
The unfinished sword, left by Kossuth, was taken up by Telos. In the Great Forges, Telos infused the blade with his own essence, meticulously crafting it to perfection. The final act of creation saw the sword cooled in the chaotic energies of [[The Tides of Chaos]], imbuing it with unparalleled power and balance.

## The Sword in the Eternal Wars

### Wielded by Telos
As the Eternal Wars erupted, Telos wielded the Sword of Eons with formidable prowess. However, after his body was shattered in battle, his wife [[Nehusta]] reconstructed him, forbidding him from bearing the sword again.

### Gift to Kossuth
Acknowledging the weapon's might and his own change of fate, Telos presented the Sword of Eons to Kossuth as a gift. Kossuth, with his deep connection to the blade's origin, accepted this powerful symbol of their bond.

## Properties of the Sword

The Sword of Eons is not just a weapon but a conduit of primordial energy. Its blade, forged from the essence of time and the fires of creation, can cut through the very fabric of reality. Its wielder can harness the combined powers of Kossuth's fire and Telos's craftsmanship, making it a fearsome tool in battle and a key artifact in cosmic events.

## Kossuth's Wielding

Kossuth, the Primordial of Fire, wields the Sword of Eons with unmatched skill and fervor. In his hands, the sword is not only a weapon but a symbol of his protective nature and his commitment to the cosmic balance. Even in the current times, Kossuth retains the sword, a reminder of the Eternal Wars and the ongoing struggles between the forces of creation and destruction.

## Conclusion

The Sword of Eons embodies the complexity and power of its creators. Forged in an era of peace yet destined for war, it represents the dual nature of creation: the ability to protect and to destroy. In the hands of Kossuth, the sword continues to play a vital role in the cosmic balance, a legacy of the primordial forces that shaped the universe.
