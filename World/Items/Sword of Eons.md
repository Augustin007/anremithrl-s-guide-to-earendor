The sword of Eons was crafted by [[Telos]] and [[Kossuth]] in the peace that was before the Eternal Wars. 
There had been smaller conflicts between the primordials, and Kossuth thought to arm himself, for he loved his siblings, and he sought to protect them, for if Kossuth had a fault it was an overprotective and jealous loyalty, and that fault has not yet left him.
In his mind he conceived the first weapons, or so he thought, for it was the whispers of [[Shar]] that spoke to him, and to others, though he knew it not. 
He asked of his brother [[Arambar]], to give him some of the time that he had made, and he began his work in the fountains of creation, and poured into it much power, but [[Akadi]] his sister turned him aside from the task, fearing this dangerous instrument.

Now, as the planes expanded, [[Telos]] was born in [[The Great Forges]] which bordered the [[Undying Pyre]] and [[Mechanus]], and he saw Kossuth work and he learned from his ways of creation, and Telos became a great builder and master in his own right.

Now Kossuth was unpredictable, and often tossed aside unfinished works, and Telos took them up and finished him, and Kossuth developed some affection for the lesser primordial. 

Telos took the unfinished blade to his home in The Great Forges, and he imbued it with his own power, and tuned it to perfection, and he worked on it for a long time, and when he was done he cooled it in [[The Tides of Chaos]].

And when the Eternal Wars broke out, Telos used this blade, until his body was broken, and when Nehusta his wife made him a new body she forbade he take up again the blade, and so he took it before Kossuth, and gave it to him as a great gift, and Kossuth would wield it through the eternal wars, and still wields it today.
