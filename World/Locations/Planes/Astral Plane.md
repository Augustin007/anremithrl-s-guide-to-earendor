The Astral Plane was a sub-plane of the Ethereal Plane where mortal souls went when they are out of time and can no longer interact with the Material Plane. [[Marethyu|The forgotten god]] created this plane as a sanctuary for those who have passed on.
When Araushnee killed the forgotten god and attempted to anchor the souls of the dead so that they could be with their loved ones forever, she shattered the Astral Plane and scattered its inhabitants into the cosmic winds. The Raven Queen pleaded with the gods in the Seven Heavens to help her, and they opened a new sanctuary for the souls - The Seven Heavens, but those who were not good would be burned from the light of [[Selune]], and fleeing from it, they found their way to [[The Nine Hells]], or worse, to the [[Abyss]].
