Cordast's Home is a demiplane created by the god-like being Cordast Tresant. It is located in an unknown region of the Eärendor planar system, and access to it can only be gained through special means. The plane itself is vast, with many different areas to explore and discover.

One of the most notable features of Cordast's Home is its architecture. The entire plane appears to be made up of a series of interconnected floating platforms, each one connected by walkways and bridges. These platforms are often covered in dense foliage and strange plants, giving the area an almost jungle-like feel.

The climate on Cordast's Home varies greatly from area to area, with some areas being quite warm and humid, while others can be cold and snowy. The plane is also home to a wide variety of creatures, both friendly and hostile. Many of these creatures are unique to the demiplane itself, and are not found anywhere else in Eärendor. 

One of these, is a helicopter-hat-like creature.

A great castle floats in this plane. A group of the [[The Hidden Thieves]], led by [[Quandale Black]], ran a heist to steal something.

[[Jess Val|Lady Black]] was caught here for some time by [[Ashdilkir]].
