The Maze of Shadows is a demiplane located in the Planar Sea, an infinite expanse of nothingness that lies between the planes. It was created by the goddess Lumia to serve as her domain and home, but she has since abandoned it and left it up to the forces of evil to claim it.

The Maze of Shadows is a labyrinthine maze filled with danger and mystery. It is inhabited by numerous creatures. The maze itself is made up of countless passages that twist and turn in on themselves, leading to hidden corners and dead ends.

The Maze of Shadows is divided into two distinct zones: the Necropolis, and the Labyrinth. 

The Necropolis is a desolate wasteland filled with decaying ruins and crumbling tombs. It is surrounded by rotted corpses and skeletal remains. Other, darker, creatures hunt from the shadows.

Finally, the Labyrinth is the most dangerous part of the maze. It surrounds the Necropolis. It is filled with twisting passages and deadly traps.
