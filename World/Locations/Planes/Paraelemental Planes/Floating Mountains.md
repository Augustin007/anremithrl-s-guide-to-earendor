# The Floating Mountains: The Paraelemental Plane of Sky and Stone

## Origin

The Floating Mountains exist in the space between the [[Gentle Zephyr]] and the [[Caverns of Stillness]]. Created from the tension between [[Akadi]]'s freedom and the [[Grumbar]]'s unyielding solidity.

## Geography

The Floating Mountains are a surreal landscape of towering peaks that float in an endless sky. The mountains drift slowly, carried by the gentle winds of the Zephyr, yet they remain rooted in their essence, never fully succumbing to the whims of the air. The plane is divided into several regions:

- **The Drifting Spires**: Tall, jagged mountains that float higher than the rest, often touching the boundaries of the Gentle Zephyr.
- **The Anchored Isles**: Smaller mountainous islands that hover closer to the plane's "ground," influenced more by the Caverns of Stillness.
- **The Whispering Canyons**: Deep valleys between the mountains, where the winds carry secrets and ancient whispers.

## Inhabitants

The Floating Mountains are home to a unique blend of air and earth creatures. Gargoyles, harpies, and stone elementals coexist with cloud giants and sylphs. These beings often serve as guides or guardians to plane-walkers and adventurers who dare to explore this paradoxical realm. They reached here before or through the [[Trees of Sanctuary]].

## Magic and Resources

The plane is rich in [[Skyrite|skyrite]], a rare mineral that combines the properties of both air and earth. It is highly sought after for its use in spells that manipulate gravity, weight, and elemental forces. However, extracting skyrite is perilous due to the plane's ever-changing geography and the protective nature of its inhabitants.

## Role before the Mortal Ages

Before the Mortal Ages, the Floating Mountains were a neutral ground where emissaries from the Gentle Zephyr and the Caverns of Stillness could meet. During the Sundered War, it served as a hidden refuge for those fleeing the conflict, its shifting landscape making it difficult for pursuers to track them. The plane has always been a place of balance, a reminder that even the most opposing forces can coexist in a delicate equilibrium.
