# The Saltlands (Quasi-Plane)

## Introduction

The Saltlands is a quasi-plane that exists in a precarious balance between the Abyss and the [[Cresting Spires]] (Plane of Water). This plane is characterized by its vast, barren landscapes of salt flats and salt-encrusted formations, a stark contrast to the tumultuous waters of the Cresting Spire and the chaotic depths of the Abyss.

## Environment and Terrain

### Salt Flats and Dunes
The most prominent feature of the Saltlands is its endless salt flats, stretching as far as the eye can see. These flats are interspersed with towering salt dunes, shaped by the rare but powerful winds that sweep across the plane.

### Salt Crystals and Formations
The landscape is dotted with large, intricate salt crystals and formations. These crystalline structures vary in size and shape, some reaching monumental proportions, creating a labyrinth of reflective surfaces that dazzle under the plane's harsh light.

### Pools of Brine
Scattered across the Saltlands are pools of highly concentrated saltwater, remnants from the Cresting Spire. These pools are both a source of life and peril, nurturing unique ecosystems while posing a threat to the unwary.

## Inhabitants

### Salt Elementals
Unique to this quasi-plane are the salt elementals, beings formed from the convergence of water and earth energies. They embody the harsh, preserving nature of salt and are often indifferent or hostile to intruders.

### Brine Creatures
Adapted to the high-salinity environment, brine creatures thrive in and around the saltwater pools. These beings range from simple, algae-like life forms to more complex organisms that have evolved unique ways to cope with the extreme conditions.

### Nomadic Collectors
A few hardy souls, drawn by the plane's unique resources, eke out an existence here. These nomadic collectors harvest salt and brine for trade with other planes, having adapted their lifestyles to the harsh environment.

## Role in Planar Interaction

### A Buffer Zone
The Saltlands act as a buffer between the chaotic evil of the Abyss and the ever-changing tides of the Cresting Spire, preventing their energies from directly clashing.

### A Path for Brave Travelers
For those capable of planar travel, the Saltlands can serve as a challenging but rewarding route. It offers a path that skirts the dangers of both the Abyss and the turbulent waters of the Cresting Spire.

## Mystical Properties

### Preservation and Desolation
The Saltlands are a plane of preservation, where time seems to slow, and decay is halted by the pervasive salt. This aspect makes it a place of interest for those studying time magic or seeking to escape the ravages of age.

### Elemental Convergence
The unique convergence of water and earth energies imbues the Saltlands with a rare form of elemental magic, sought after by alchemists and spellcasters for its unique properties.

## Conclusion

The Saltlands is a realm of stark beauty and harsh survival, embodying the elemental forces of preservation and desolation. It stands as a testament to the diverse and often unforgiving nature of the multiverse, offering unique challenges and opportunities to those who traverse its saline expanse. As a quasi-plane between realms of water and darkness, it serves as a unique crossroads, both physically and metaphorically, in the tapestry of the planes.
