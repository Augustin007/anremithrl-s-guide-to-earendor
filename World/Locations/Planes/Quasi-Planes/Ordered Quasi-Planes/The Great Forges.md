# The Great Forges (Quasi-Plane)

## Introduction

The Great Forges is a quasi-plane located between Mechanus, the epitome of order and precision, and the [[Undying Pyre]], the Plane of Fire known for its raw, unbridled energy. This plane was once the dominion of [[Telos]], a master of creation and craftsmanship, before his retreat to Elysium with [[Nehusta|his wife]].

## Environment and Structure

### Forges of Creation
The landscape of the Great Forges is dominated by colossal forges and anvils, some the size of mountains, constantly alight with divine fires from the Undying Pyre. These forges are where the raw materials from both adjoining planes are melded into creations of unparalleled craftsmanship.

### The Iron Valleys
Surrounding the forges are valleys filled with veins of precious metals and minerals, providing the essential materials for the forges. The topography is marked by deep canyons and towering plateaus, shaped by the ceaseless activity of the forges.

### The Rivers of Molten Metal
Flowing through the plane are rivers of molten metal and alloys, their bright glow illuminating the Great Forges. These rivers are crucial for the plane's operations, supplying material for the creation of artifacts and constructs.

## Inhabitants and Culture

### Forge Guardians
Mighty beings known as Forge Guardians, created by Telos, oversee the operations of the forges. They are embodiments of both fire and order, maintaining the balance necessary for the forges to function efficiently.

### Elemental Smiths
Elemental beings from both the Undying Pyre and Mechanus work in harmony here, their skills complementing each other to produce works of incredible power and beauty. They are skilled artisans, deeply devoted to the art of creation.

### Nomadic Artificers
Artificers and craftsmen from various planes are drawn to the Great Forges, seeking to learn its secrets and harness its power. These individuals often travel across planes, spreading the knowledge and craftsmanship they acquire.

## Historical Significance

### Realm of Telos
Telos, renowned for his skill and ingenuity, once presided over this plane, turning it into a center of creation and invention. His legacy remains in the form of the constructs and artifacts that still emerge from the forges.

### The Retreat to Elysium
The departure of Telos and Nehusta to Elysium marked a significant shift in the plane's history. Their absence left a void that was filled by the Forge Guardians, who continue to uphold the traditions and standards set by Telos.

## Role in the Multiverse

### Hub of Artifacts and Constructs
The Great Forges is renowned across the planes as the birthplace of some of the most powerful artifacts and constructs in existence. Items forged here are highly sought after for their quality and magical properties.

### Symbol of Harmony Between Fire and Order
The plane represents a unique harmony between the chaotic nature of fire and the structured order of Mechanus. It serves as a testament to the possibility of balance between seemingly opposing forces.

## Conclusion

The Great Forges stands as a monument to the art of creation, where the fires of the Undying Pyre and the order of Mechanus converge. It remains a pivotal plane for those seeking to create or acquire items of extraordinary power. The legacy of Telos continues to inspire the inhabitants, maintaining the Great Forges as a crucial nexus of craftsmanship and innovation in the multiverse.
