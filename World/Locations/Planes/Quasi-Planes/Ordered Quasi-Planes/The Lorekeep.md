Overseen by the god of knowledge, [[Nebelum]], this quasi-plane is the repository of an unparalleled collection of books, manuscripts, and artifacts, striving to encompass all known wisdom.

### The Map Library
Due to the immense scale of the Grand Library, a secondary library, known as the Map Library, is dedicated to helping navigate the primary library.
