# The Abyss

## Introduction

The Abyss, a realm of unfathomable darkness and chaos, is an integral part of the [[Eärendor|Universe]]'s cosmic landscape. It stands in stark contrast to the sanctuaries of light and order, embodying the very essence of entropy and malevolence. This plane is not only a physical location but also a manifestation of the darker aspects of existence, deeply connected to the Primordial entity [[Shar]] and her ally, [[Tartarus]].

## Nature of the Abyss

### Infinite Layers of Darkness
The Abyss is composed of infinite layers, each a unique manifestation of despair, chaos, and destruction. These layers are not static; they shift and change, influenced by the powerful beings that reside within and the ever-present malevolent will of the Abyss itself.

### The Heart of Entropy
At its core, the Abyss is a realm of pure entropy. It is a place where order unravels, and the fundamental laws of the Universe are warped and twisted. This chaotic nature makes it a dangerous and unpredictable realm, even for its denizens.

## Inhabitants

### Demonic Entities
The Abyss is home to countless demonic entities, each embodying aspects of chaos and evil. These beings range from lesser demons, driven by base instincts, to powerful lords who command vast territories within the Abyss.

### Lost Souls
The Abyss also traps the souls of those who, through action or circumstance, find themselves ensnared by its dark allure. These lost souls are often subjected to torment and transformation, becoming part of the Abyss's nightmarish landscape.

### Tartarus and Shar
[[Tartarus]], a Primordial of chaos and destruction, reigns over portions of the Abyss, wielding considerable power and influence. Shar, the Whisperer in the Shadows, though not residing permanently in the Abyss, is deeply connected to it, her influence permeating its layers.

## Role in Cosmic Events

### A Catalyst for Conflict
The Abyss has played a pivotal role in cosmic events, particularly in the Eternal Wars. Its influence and the entities it harbors have often been the source of strife and discord in the Universe.

### The Antithesis of Order
As a realm opposite to places of light and order, like Elysium, the Abyss serves as a counterbalance in the cosmic equilibrium. It represents the necessary chaos that complements and challenges the forces of order.

## Influence Beyond Its Borders

### The Spread of Chaos
The malevolent influence of the Abyss extends beyond its borders, affecting other planes and realms. It is a source of corruption, tempting beings with promises of power and freedom, only to ensnare them in its dark embrace.

### The Threat of Invasion
Periodically, the denizens of the Abyss attempt to extend their reach into other realms, leading to conflicts and invasions that threaten the stability of the Universe.

## Conclusion

The Abyss is a realm of endless darkness and chaos, a place where the worst nightmares are given form. It is an essential part of the cosmic balance, embodying the chaos and destruction that counter the forces of order and light. Its influence is far-reaching, shaping events and beings across the Universe, and serving as a constant reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of existence.
