The Cresting Spires, also known as the Plane of Water, is a realm of ever-changing tides and boundless depths. Governed by [[Istishia]], the Elemental Sibling of Water, this plane is a haven for those who find solace in the ebb and flow of the cosmic tides.

Due to [[Dur-baagal]]'s manipulation of Time, the currents within the Cresting Spires are unpredictable, sometimes flowing backward or standing still, making navigation a challenge even for the most experienced plane-walkers.

Istishia often hid [[Atropus]] here, and it was here that the first of the Celestials were built.

It is the closest plane in the Universe to Pandemonium.

The plane resonates with the elemental force of fluidity and change, a testament to Istishia's mastery over the waters. Those who can harness these elemental energies find their powers magnified within the Cresting Spires. 

There is no air in the Cresting Spires, for [[Akadi]] seldom visited, since [[Istishia]] and Istishia fought during the Eternal Wars.

Few have ever tried to visit this plane, for it is difficult to survive its chaos, and little is known about what belongs there to the mortals.

But it is there that the that Istishia contains the last fragments of the essence of Atropus, and here too that some of the first attempts to create the Celestials, when it was only Atropus and Istishia, still remain unfinished.

For those who can walk between planes, the Cresting Spires are connected to the Paraelemental Planes:
  [[Frostfell]]
  [[Swamp of Oblivion]]
  [[Boiling Seas]]

And these area the Quasi Planes connected to the Plane of Water
  [[The Cloudkeep]]
  [[The Saltlands]]
  [[The Tides of Chaos]]
  [[The Golden Pools]]
