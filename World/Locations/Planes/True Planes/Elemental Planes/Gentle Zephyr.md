The Gentle Zephyr, also known as the Plane of Air, is a realm of boundless skies and endless winds, a sanctuary of freedom and movement. Governed by [[Akadi]], the Elemental Sibling of Air, this plane stands in stark contrast to the Caverns of Stillness. It is a place where the air is alive with the songs of the wind, and where the clouds dance in an eternal ballet.

The Plane of Air is untouched by [[Dur-baagal]]'s manipulation of Time, making it one of the few realms where time flows as it should. 

The elemental resonance of the Gentle Zephyr is one of constant motion and change. It is a realm where the winds carry whispers of ancient secrets and where the ever-changing clouds hold the memories of the [[Eärendor|Universe]]. Those who can tap into these elemental forces find themselves empowered, their abilities magnified manifold.

Akadi befriended the Greater Council of Gods before the Sundering War, and some manners of creatures were created there. It is the only of the elemental planes to have its own life and creation. Here, for example, come the Aarakokra and the Djinn, and many others. And when the [[Trees of Sanctuary]] was formed, many creatures from the Plane of Air were caught in the [[Material Plane]], and many creatures from the Material Plane were caught in the Plane of Air. 

[[Sardior]], a lesser god who deserted during the Sundered war hid himself in the gentle Zephyr from the wrath of [[Thalorin]].

There are great cities in the Plane of Air.

The Plane of Air is the gentlest for the plane-walkers, some of which even come from this plane. Because there are families separated by the Tree of Names, many plane-walkers have made fortunes by sending messages back and forth.

For those who can walk between planes, the Gentle Zephyr is connected to the Paraelemental Planes:
  [[Frostfell]]
  [[Great Conflagration]]
  [[Floating Mountains]]

Quasi Planes
  [[The Thunderpeak]]
  [[The Vacuum]]
  [[The Halls of Dissonance]]
  [[The Evanescent Music]]
