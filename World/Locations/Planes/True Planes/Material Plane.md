#Planes_and_Regions/True 

Things nether enter nor exit the Material Plane because of the [[Trees of Sanctuary]].  Only the Plane-walkers can slip through the branches of this multi-dimensional tree.

The Material Plane is divided into different sub-planes.
  [[Shadowfell]] (The sub-plane of Memory)
  [[Feywild]]  (The sub-plane of Illusion)
  [[Ephemeral Lands]] (The sub-plane of Mortality)
  [[Echo plane]] (Remnants of the ethereal plane that form around the sections of the material plane)

Quasi-Planes
  [[The Seven Heavens]]
  [[The Nine Hells]]
  [[The Fractured Realms]]
  [[The Lorekeep]]
