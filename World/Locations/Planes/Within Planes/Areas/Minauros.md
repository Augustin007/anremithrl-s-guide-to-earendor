Minauros is a one of the layers located in the Nine Hells. It is ruled by [[Archduke Mammon]] and [[Tiamat]]. The plane consists of an endless swamp of putrid water that smells of rot and decay. Minauros is a place of greed and avarice, where those who seek to accumulate wealth and power will eventually end up, attracted to the amount of greed that fills the air. But no one living here can get a drop of wealth, because the Archduke and Tiamat take it all.

In minauros, there are greed-eating creatures known as Mammonites.

Those who fail to heed the warnings of the swamp and its denizens often fall victim to the greedy claws of Mammonites and other creatures that dwell in Minauros's waters.
