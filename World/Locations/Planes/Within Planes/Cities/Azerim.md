Azerim is a city in the north of Golin. It has a rich history of trade relations and was once home of a portal between the [[Ephemeral Lands]] and the [[Gentle Zephyr]]. 

 
Lord Nerach Azerim was a powerful lord of Azerim. He looked into a guild of criminals which was forming in the area and drove them out. Twelve years later he was assassinated by one of these criminals.

He spoiled his daughter, [[Narnor]], sending her to study magic at [[Strixhaven]]. Being rich, she often got in trouble expecting her father to bail her out, but almost got herself and her friends expelled. 

When Nerach died, Narnor took up Ladyship of Azerim. She spent some time trying to uncover the mystery of her father's death, collecting some evidence of the order known as the Greenclad, an order of assassins and thieves who originated in Rymfel and spread to nearby countries, and she began trying to root them out.

She was also the one who allowed the [[Order of Pacis]] to set up an outpost in her land, an order devoted to hospitality.

She was assasinated shortly thereafter.

[[Nil'ge'tar Remshi'ul]] and [[Colossus Methunroa]] would go through the town, bringing [[PINE-APL]]. They would sell a slave and buy some items in the town, including a well-crafted spear.

It eventually became a stronghold for NAF forces after the routing at Aldarkeep pass.
