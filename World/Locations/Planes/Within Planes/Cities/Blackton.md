Blackton is a small city in the country of [[Rymfel]]. It was one of the forty cities sacked in the first onslaught of the great orc war. Shortly thereafter, the halfling [[Quandale Black|Lord Quandale Amos Black]], a prominent figure of the criminal empire, [[The Hidden Thieves]], managed to secure the lordship of the ruins. He helped rebuild the town in order to use it as a base for his criminal activities.
