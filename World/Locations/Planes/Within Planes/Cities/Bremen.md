Bremen is a large city for trade located north-west of [[Goodmead]] in the country of [[Durinor]]. It is nestled against a large cliff face on the south on which a great sky-port is built. It was founded before [[Auril]] escaped the nine-hells. 

It is mostly populated by Dwarves and Goliaths, though other species roam it as well.

When Durinor fell under the influence of the spell of eternal winter, Bremen was caught in this. 

There are tunnels that lead to the [[Underdark]] in Bremen. 

The house [[Decaius]] of [[Neros]] have ancestors from Bremen.

[[Ashdilkir]] came to Bremen and founded the [[Den]], a ring of followers which would obtain for her what she needed, bring her news, and carry out her orders. [[Miyatol Dodonus]] went north and investigated several assassination, managing to capture members of the Den. With [[Tal'berius]]'s help, he was able to lay a trap and arrest most of them at a meeting. [[Tal'berius]] was driven away by his former friend [[Kas]], who allied himself with Ashdilkir, and Ashdilkir killed Miyatol and obtained [[Vecna]]'s heart, repurposing the lair that guarded it into her own..

Ashdilkir slowly lost her memory and her sanity, she wrote down everything she remembered, and over thirty-thousand years of her memories are in her personal library hidden in the caves of the underdark, deep beneath Bremen. 

[[Jessica Black|Lady Black]], and [[Nil'ge'tar Remshi'ul|Prince Nil'ge'tar (Nugget)]] left behind a bomb in a fountain when they passed by the city, which killed a family of four. This was blamed on the outcast Goliath [[Dirk]], who was executed for their crime. This also increased the tension between the Goliaths and Dwarves of the town. 

Tal'berius used the [[Echoes of Divinity]] crew to get to Bremen to conceal himself from [[Kas]] of Torin, who secretly rules the city. 

When they returned, Lady Black showed great remorse over what happened, while Nugget was unmoved. 

Nugget, wanting to exacerbate the race tensions, execute seven dwarves in an alleyway and wrote the words "For Dirk" on the wall in their blood.
