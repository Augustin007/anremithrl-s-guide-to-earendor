Goodmead is located in the northernmost region of [[Eärendor]], in the country of [[Durinor]]. The city once sat on a fertile plain surrounded by lush forests and rolling hills. It was known for its rich soil and bountiful harvests, making it an important trade center for foodstuffs and agricultural goods. Goodmead was a hub of commerce and culture in Durinor, with many merchants and traders passing through on their way to the nearby cities of [[Bremen]] and Bardstown. The city is also home to several notable landmarks, including the Great Market Square, which hosts a weekly farmers' market, and the Goodmead Academy of Magic, one of the oldest institutions for magic study in Eärendor. Even though [[Auril]] has frozen over the land, and it is no longer such a bountiful place, the people of Goodmead are known for their hospitality and love of music.
