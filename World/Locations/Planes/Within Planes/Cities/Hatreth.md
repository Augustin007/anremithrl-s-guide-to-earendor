Hatreth is a small town in Neros. It is surrounded by forests, and founded by the group of farmers who settled in the area to cultivate crops and raise livestock.

The people of Hatreth slew [[Yvana]], a druid and a warlock of [[Ferus]], the god of the wild. As punishment for this, Ferus turned a wild boar into a lesser beast dragon, who became known in the region as [[Claron]]. He was eventually slain by travelers [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] and [[Baeor Dechaius]].
