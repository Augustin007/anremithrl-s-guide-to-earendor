Bharam is an ancient kingdom located in the northernmost reaches of Eärendor. The cult known as the [[Dreamers of Bharam]] took over the government of Crof and renamed it Bharam. They are brutal and inhumane, enslaving, raping, and killing those who are not of their cult.

The Dreamers of Bharam's Alliances

The cult of Bharam has allied itself with Tartarus and the Betrayer Gods, making them even more powerful and dangerous than they already were. They are not afraid to use their strength to enforce their will on others.
