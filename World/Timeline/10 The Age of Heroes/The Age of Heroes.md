The Age of Heroes was a renaissance of sorts, a period of resurgence that followed the grim and tumultuous Age of Shadows. It was a time when the virtues of courage, wisdom, and unity were not just ideals but necessities for survival and progress.

- **Rise of Heroes**: This age was named for the great heroes who emerged, individuals of extraordinary skill and valor. They took it upon themselves to rid the world of lingering abominations, remnants of the Sundered Wars and the dark magic of the Age of Shadows.

- **Vestiges of the Past**: The discovery of ancient artifacts and magical relics from the time of the Sundered Wars became a focal point. These vestiges were sought after not just for their power but for the wisdom they contained, offering insights into long-forgotten magics and technologies.

- **Undoing Dark Magic**: Wizards and scholars of immense power and knowledge worked tirelessly to reverse the malevolent spells and curses left by the Betrayer gods. Their efforts cleansed tainted lands and restored natural order, gradually diminishing the dark magic that had plagued the world.

- **Formation of Alliances and Empires**: As stability returned, various kingdoms and tribes found common ground. Alliances were forged, leading to the establishment of the first great empires. These empires became bastions of governance and law, bringing much-needed order to the Ephemeral Lands.

- **Focus on Wisdom and Knowledge**: The age saw the founding of the first universities and scholarly institutions. Wisdom and knowledge were highly valued, and these centers of learning became the crucibles where the next generation of leaders, scholars, and heroes were forged.

- **Conflicts and Challenges**: Despite the progress, the age was not without its share of conflicts. Territorial disputes, power struggles, and ideological differences led to wars and skirmishes. However, these conflicts were generally less devastating compared to those of previous ages, and they often led to social and political advancements.

The Age of Heroes was a transformative period that left an indelible mark on the history of the Ephemeral Lands. It was an era that saw the best of what mortals could achieve when united by common goals and enlightened by wisdom. The legacies of this age would serve as the cornerstone for future generations, a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people.


> **From "The Writ of Kesna", by Tar-Valsaris II**
> 
> In the land of Heth, nestled between the fractured peaks and winding rivers of the Shattered Teeth, lived a man named Eldan. Born into a humble family of fishermen and farmers, Eldan's early years were spent in the shadow of Heth's coastal cliffs, where the roar of the ocean met the whispers of ancient forests. Despite the hardships of living in a land scarred by chaos and war, the people of Heth were resilient, finding solace in their traditions and the natural beauty that surrounded them.
> 
> From a young age, Eldan was captivated by the stories of old, tales of the great library of Eldorath and the knowledge it once housed. His parents, proud of their descent from Eldorath, named him after the fabled city. They often shared with him the legends of Nebelum, the patron god of Eldorath, who valued wisdom and peace. Eldan's curiosity grew into an obsession as he sought to learn all he could about the lost knowledge and the god who had inspired it.
> 
> As Eldan grew, he spent more time studying history and the ancient texts that had survived the Sundering. His passion for learning led him to the village priest, who recognized the boy's fervor and began teaching him the ways of Nebelum. Eldan's dedication was unparalleled, and he soon became the priest's most promising disciple.
> 
> The storms of chaos had been growing incredibly powerful in this time, and one of these destroyed many homes and crops. Eldan, now a young man, stepped forward to lead the recovery efforts. His calm demeanor and unwavering faith in Nebelum inspired those around him. 
> 
> The devotion spread throughout the western part of the Shattered Teeth, and shrines for Nebelum soon became very popular.
> 
> He spoke against the Cobalt Order and their secrecy, and they hated him in return. In the dead of night, hired Rassac assassins killed Eldan and his family and set fire to his village.

> The seeds of the Thousand-Year War were sown in the quiet shadows and whispered intrigues of Cyddartiame. As the Magisters of Cyddartiame grew bolder in their ambitions, their desire for dominion clashed with the steadfast resolve of the Kesnan Kingdom. The Kesnan rulers, descended from Duren and the Vorokai, valued their independence and were determined to protect their people from the insidious reach of the Cobalt Order.
> 
> Tensions between Cyddartiame and the Kesnan Kingdom had simmered for centuries. The Magisters, masters of subterfuge and manipulation, had long used their network of spies to destabilize their enemies. The Kesnan Kingdom, however, had grown resilient and vigilant, often thwarting Cyddartiame's covert operations.
> 
> The war's catalyst came when Cyddartiame's agents orchestrated the assassination of King Bormik, a beloved Kesnan ruler known for his wisdom and strength. The assassination was meant to plunge the Kesnan Kingdom into chaos, but instead, it galvanized the Kesnan people. Bormik's son, Prince Eldak, ascended to the throne, vowing to bring the Magisters to justice and end their shadowy reign.
> 
> The early years of the war were marked by skirmishes and small-scale battles. While the Kesnan kingdom had the advantage of a long martial tradition. the Magisters, wielding ancient and powerful magic, unleashed devastating arcane attacks on Kesnan strongholds.
> 
> As the war dragged on, it became a grueling war of attrition. Both sides suffered tremendous losses, and neither could gain a decisive advantage. The Kesnan Kingdom fortified its defenses, building massive walls and underground bunkers to protect its cities. Cyddartiame, in turn, fortified its mountainous stronghold, Cydaris, with layers of enchantments and traps.
> 
> The conflict spilled into every aspect of life in the Shattered Teeth. Trade routes were disrupted, causing widespread famine and economic hardship. Tribes and smaller nations were forced to choose sides or face annihilation. The Triumvirate Alliance fractured as internal conflicts arose, with some members choosing to ally with Cyddartiame, drawn by promises of power and protection.
> 
> One of the war's most significant battles occurred at Pyrfan Keep, a crucial Kesnan fortress guarding a vital mountain pass. Cyddartiame launched a massive assault, hoping to break through and strike at the heart of the Kesnan Kingdom. The defenders, led by General Lothas, held out for months under relentless siege, allowing Cyddartiame to spend their strength against them. In the end he drove them away, resulting in a costly victory for the Kesnans.
> 
> In the 500th year of the war, the Kesnan Kingdom launched a bold offensive against Cydaris itself. Led by Queen Aria, a direct descendant of Edrin, the Kesnan forces managed to breach the outer defenses of the city. The Siege of Cydaris lasted for three years, with both sides suffering catastrophic losses. The storms of Chaos grew to great, and the Kesnans were forced to retreat, unable to overcome the formidable enchantments protecting the city.
> 
> The war was often interrupted by great storms of chaos, and by truces that lasted for long amounts of time.
> 
> As the war approached its millennium mark, both sides were exhausted. The Kesnan Kingdom, though battered, remained unbroken. Cyddartiame, despite its powerful magic, struggled to maintain control over its vast network of spies and agents.
> 
> After King Duren XIV's death, Malachar, the Grand Magistier brokered a peace treaty with his successor Varnak. They ended the war, both weak and battered from a millenium of constant fighting.
> 
> In this time, King Eldan II of the Vossari, named after Eldan of Heth, known as Eldan Bauglak, united many countries in a great alliance. He saw the two countries as weakened, and thought that he could conquer them both. He broke his alliance with Kesna and attacked them first, and then Cyddartiame. This caused the great alliance between Kesna and Cyddartiame. Together they defeated Bauglak.
> 
> Seeing benefit in this alliance, and desiring peace, Varnak forged the great alliance with the Cyddartiame during this time. And they supported each other during several conflicts.
