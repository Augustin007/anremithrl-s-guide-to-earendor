#### The Age of Shadows

The Age of Shadows was a grim epoch, a stark contrast to the hopeful rebuilding that had characterized the end of the Age of Wandering. This was a time when the veil between the mortal realm and the darker planes of existence seemed perilously thin.

- **Rise of Dark Powers**: The goddess Shar, emboldened by her newfound influence, attempted to free Tartarus from the Nine Hells. Though thwarted by Selune, her malevolent whispers spread like wildfire among the mortal populace, sowing seeds of discord and betrayal.

- **Dark Kingdoms**: As Shar's influence grew, so did the power of dark magic. Kingdoms that embraced these forbidden arts rose to prominence, their rulers wielding terrible power. These dark realms were often at odds with each other, their internal strife spilling over into wars that engulfed the Ephemeral Lands.

- **The Trees of Sanctuary**: During this age, the gods discovered a new way to interact with the mortal realm. By channeling their divine essence through the Trees of Sanctuary, both Betrayers and Protectors found they could influence events more directly, using mortals as conduits for their will.

- **Quest for Ascension**: Inspired by the Raven Queen's rise to divinity, many mortals sought to emulate her Ascension. Secret societies were formed, arcane rituals were devised, and quests for godhood became the obsession of kings and sorcerers alike. Few succeeded, and many paid a terrible price for their hubris.

- **Brink of Catastrophe**: The constant warring, the rise of dark magic, and the meddling of gods led many to believe that a second Sundering was imminent. Prophets and seers spoke of apocalyptic visions, and for a time, it seemed as though the world was on the brink of another cataclysm.

- **Resilience of Mortals**: Despite the pervasive darkness, the indomitable spirit of mortals shone through. New kingdoms were founded, cities were built, and alliances were formed. Though these were often fraught with their own sets of challenges, they stood as beacons of hope in a world overshadowed by malevolent forces.

The Age of Shadows was a time of great peril, but it was also a period that tested the mettle of mortals and gods alike. It was an era that proved, even in the darkest of times, that the will to survive could not be easily extinguished. The lessons of this age would be carried forward, serving as both a warning and an inspiration for the generations to come.

Hechilspet arose during this time.

The age of Shadows ended and the Age of Heroes began when Lysiria and Eolande took from the nine hells the Silanderi, which were made of light from Selune. And thus Selune's influence was vanquished.
