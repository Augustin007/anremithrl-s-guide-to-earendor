#### Summary
In the valley of Echoriath in the Shattered Region, different tribes settle their differences and unite to form the Kesnan Kingdom and deal with the threats of the early age of Shadows.
Thalen Nokkaran, Eledan Lodis, and Duren Vorasthar are members from different tribes who act as representatives for their respective tribes at a yearly inter-tribe trade meeting. They begin travelling and meet on the way to this meeting, and have loose beginnings of friendship.
