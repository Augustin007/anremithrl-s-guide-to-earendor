The campaign begins as Sir Eamon Cardvas, an Aka'lit knight, and his newly appointed squire, Orris Haldwin, ride hard toward the Temple of Lys Alar. They have traveled for three days straight, spurred by grim news—Sir Andros Velmir, Eamon’s former master and mentor, is dead. The official report claims he lost his footing and fell from the cliffs outside the temple, but the story does not sit well with Eamon, who knew Andros very well.

After meeting with some of the others and speaking about the tragedy, including Sir Baelor, who insults Sir Andros and dismisses Eamon's concerns. Lord Faelon believes that Eamon is being driven primarily by grief, and doesn't want to enable this. After some pestering, Eamon is told exactly where the body was found. Riding out with his squire in the knight, the two spot a shadowed beast attacking a merchant. They fight it off. The merchant doesn't talk much, and has a foreign accent, he seems a bit shocked by the attack. Since the merchant's horses ran off, they take him with them to inspect the site of the murder. While there's no conclusive evidence, there's some signs of a struggle up on the cliffs, and Eamon is fairly certain it was no accident. 

After returning to the temple, Sir Levar greets them, who hadn't really known Andros, but was a friend of Eamon. He recently arrived. He ushers the three inside and has food prepared for them, as they are exhausted. At their asking he makes sure to provide new horses for the merchant.

They communicate to him, and he tries to be as helpful as possible all the same. He admits he found the situation strange. And writes a letter to send to their superiors.
