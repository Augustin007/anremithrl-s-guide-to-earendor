They recieve no message in return. The two find documents burnt in a fireplace in Aldros's room, and wonder what occured. They can't piece anything together, other than a name Lorien Vass. Sir Alden Caelar, Eamon's good friend, arrives at the temple from Lys Maran. He speaks with both of them, agreeing that this is strange. They head out to show the meager evidence they have, but they find a market has been set up in the region. They struggle a bit with the various locals since the Aka'lit are held in high regard. There's too much disturbance to show Alden the evidence.
They attend the funeral. A stranger attends and says nothing.
Talking over the evidence, the four come to the conclusion that there must be traitors or some corruption in the Aka'lit, which is not really a new idea.
