Having to seperate ways at the temple, as Lorien isn't allowed in, Lorien waits outside. After speaking with the archivist knights, he finds out that any documentation of Aldros went up in flames the night after he died, along with a large portion of the archives. A senior knight, Sir Marius Dravon, gives Eamon more information in passing, that Andros was investigating some smuggling, and reported something or other about black ships.

Eamon discovers that the message sent by Levar never made it, and likely was intercepted along the way.

But Eamon isn’t the only one searching. A mysterious noblewoman, Lady Syrella Veyne, has also been asking questions about Andros. After speaking with her, he uncovers details about Andros travelling as far north as Crantaa and meeting with her.

Eamon returns and finds Lorien.

Eamon regroups with Levar and Orris at a tavern in Port Vareth, the other two don't trust Lorien, and keep him away from the council.

Levar reveals that Markov’s summons was a ruse—when they arrived at Calaedron Keep, Markov wasn’t even present. Someone forged his orders.
