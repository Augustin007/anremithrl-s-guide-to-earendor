#### Summary
Two very different twin brothers guard a vital outpost in the middle of nowhere, but are pulled into an adventure to save their land.
Anremithrl and Lesalog fight a group of attackers and try to communicate back that the place was attacked. They find out other nearby outposts have been attacked and use a riskier form of communication to warn the country. They question their captives and begin uncovering a plot by a dark wizard named Malach to conquer the country of Avmorei. As the only remaining military forces this far out, they're sent to uncover more.
