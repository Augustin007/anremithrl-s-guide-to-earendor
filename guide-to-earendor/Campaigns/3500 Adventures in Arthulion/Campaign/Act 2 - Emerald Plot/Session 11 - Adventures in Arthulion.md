The next morning, a revenge-driven but level-headed Theriad confronts the two in their cells. He explains that his guard has run their own investigation, but any documents at Leraniel's place has burnt up in an 'accident' soon after the beginning of his investigation. 

The two decide to trust him and point Theriad to Noros, who kept the evidence they had. After a few hours, Theriad returns, his investigation having proved fruitful and uncovered more of the plot. 

Theriad appoints Feanor’s old seneschal Anor to temporary lordship and forces him to grant a pardon to Duthrim, Jason, and Kenaralis.

With the aid of Theriad's resources, Kenaralis's experience, and the documents Noros had kept safe, they discover the truth of the plot, that being a foreign influence from Sonorous. Noloric weapons being imported into Sonorous. 

Feeling safe and unhunted for the first time, Jason and Duthrim relax and drink and play some board games with Kenaralis, and invite Theriad, trying to cheer the grief-stricken man up. Jason is exceptionally good at chess, rivaled only by Theriad. Theriad and Duthrim bond over having both been displaced by the eruption of the flameheart.
