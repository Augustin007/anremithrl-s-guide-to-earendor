Theriad discusses with Jason and Duthrim what to do. They track down a lead in the city and attempt to capture him, foiling his attempted suicide. They are attacked by a contingent of soldiers. During the ensuing conflict, the enemy suddenly focuses on Theriad, who reveals himself as a powerful mage and duelist. All the same, he falters under the sudden onslaught and Jason and Duthrim save his life when his guard can't get to him in time. Theriad's guard conducts further investigations and reach similar conclusions, supporting Jason and Duthrim.

Lenor, Feanor's son, arrives and takes lordship as Lord Lenor II. He re-arrests Jason and Duthrim, and comes bearing a writ from Baron Mabry, styled inexplicably as "king" Mabry, confirming some details about Theriad's status but strips Theriad of his guard. While a few remain loyal, many leave. Theriad is attempting to contact others and re-make his plans when Lenor's soldiers arrive and set the manor aflame and kill the fleeing servants. Most of the loyal guards die as Theriad and his guard fight their way out. They storm the prison and break Jason and Duthrim free, then escape the city and flee to Beden.
