Jason attempts to get evidence by breaking into Mabry's safe, but it turns out to be a mimic. Jason is captured.

Duthrim and Thalion try to stall by lying about knowing more about the rebels, but Mabry seems uninterested in that. Instead, he tells them that he looked into Jason, and that he was immediately warned by his liaison with the Sonorous government to stop looking into it and told to make sure not to kill him. Apparently looking into Jason had killed Leraniel. Since he can't ask his contacts in the dominion, he wants to ask Duthrim and Thalion.

Jason is put in a cell with Theriad. Theriad is despondent. Lenas is nursing fairly bad injuries and Jason tries to save him, but fails, bolstering Theriad's despondence. 

Galin berates Theriad, which angers him, and Jason steps in. 

Jason admits, speaking slowly and avoiding details, about his own family, stating that his own father, as well as his sister and mother, were also killed by a treasonous baron in service of the Sonorous Dominion, and that Jason burnt down his own family palace to kill as many enemies as he could as he escaped. The two talk a bit more and bond, Jason is very closed off, and refuses to give any details about who he is and what happened to his family, but accepts Theriad's offer to be brothers at heart. 

With Theriad's help, the three of them escape their cell. In an impulsive act as they get away, mirroring Jason's story, Theriad sets a fire in the dungeons of his own family's palace.

At around this time, Mabry leaves Thalion and Duthrim and thus hears of Jason's capture. He sets guards to arrest Thalion and Duthrim. Just then Theriad, Galin, and Jason arrive. They kill two of the guards and capture the others, taking Mabry hostage.
