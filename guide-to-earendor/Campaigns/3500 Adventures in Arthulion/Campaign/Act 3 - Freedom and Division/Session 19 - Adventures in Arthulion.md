Jason and Theriad arrive in the clockwork citadel. 

That night Theriad dreams of a vast library, a single figure tending to it. He draws the image the next morning.

Theriad meets Methunroa, his mentor for his doctorate, and begins to study under him. He presents his ideas, partially inspired (though he does not say it aloud), out of something he saw with the Sonorous soldiers during his time in Nerheim, the idea of teleportation magic. Theriad quickly impresses Methunroa with his sharp mind and memory, but struggles to feel safe and struggles with his despondance. His hand shake near-constantly.

Jason finds the silence unbearable and lashes out against other students and teachers.

Jason's mentor, Falledric, is rather heartless and cold to Jason, and Jason barely is able to talk to him. This increases his isolation. 

Jason joins the dueling club and wins and loses a number of practice duels. He is too violent, often seeming to aim to harm, causing him to be reprimanded. During a later practice he imagines the dummies to be actual enemies until he breaks the dummies and the practice staffs.

He and Theriad meet at the Golden Wheel bar, and argue about philosophy.

In the evening a patrol of guards marches by the university and their echoing boots send Jason into a panic. Theriad is also tense, and Jason turns his panic onto Theriad, mocking him and calling him soft.

Neither of them sleep that night.
