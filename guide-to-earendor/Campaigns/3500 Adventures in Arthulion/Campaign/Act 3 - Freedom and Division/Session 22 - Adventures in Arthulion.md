Lira spends time talking to Jason. She helps him feel better.

Jason spends most days in the duelling yard. His fights have become exhibitions, half sport and half spectacle. Lira watches from the balcony, sometimes cheering, sometimes turning away when his blows land too hard. He wins a silver token in the monthly tournament and hands it to her without explanation. She keeps it.

Theriad experiments with broadening his technique by increasing the energy of an individual twine and passing matter through it. Increasing the energy of a single twine continuously fails, and it is taking too much energy when it keeps on getting lost to twines around it. This does not make sense under the current model and Methunroa becomes very interested. 

The Free Thought League hosts a debate. They print pamphlets calling for independence from “foreign gold.” Jason’s speeches are fiery and persuasive, though even his allies seem uneasy at his vehemence.

Theriad feels rather hollow, and spends a lot of time thinking about Elara and about how many people he has lost. He starts panicking worrying about losing people here.

An undergraduate Sonorous kid named Rethin, the son of a foundry-worker on a grant, joins the dueling club, who professes admiration for the High Baron, Lord Grellan, who gave him the grant. Jason confronts him the moment he hears the name Grellan. The other members of the club try to separate them, but Jason forces the matter. He brutalises the kid in the ensuing duel, shattering his wrist and collarbone. 

He is called before the school council. Lira attends, sitting in the back row. Jason refuses apology or explanation. Theriad and Methunroa barely arrive in time to intervene for him. The council assigns probation and mandatory restraint training. He is expelled from the dueling club, but manages to just barely stay in the school. Theriad and Methunroa try to talk to Jason, but he finds them condescending and nonunderstanding. Lira follows him afterward and tells him she’s frightened for him. He insists he is fine and shouts at her. 

Falledric disproves not of the violence but of being so sloppy in the execution and getting into trouble. Falledric is not a violent person, but he does believe in following goals with any means. Jason feels like Falledric is the only person not being condecending, and finally starts following him.

Methunroa and Theriad agree that keeping on eye on Jason might be for the best.

Jason goes to drink that night.
