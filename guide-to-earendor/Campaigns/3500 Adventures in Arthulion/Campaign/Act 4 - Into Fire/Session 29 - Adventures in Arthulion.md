They reach the borders of the dominion, but can see an army gathering in the distance, already ready for them. A whole legion, a show of force, blocking all the ways they can see. They stay well away, and travel for three days a long way around the river. Again, the meeting point is blocked. A third time they do it, riding even further East, as fast as they can manage, to the Mountain of Tears, hoping to outstrip them, but a different legion, with different colours, awaits them at their destination. Nerol complains about the travelling and says they should give up. 

Recognizing the shear infeasibility of having one of the twelve legions at one of hundreds of border crossings, even accounting for the Sonorous holding technology like the pocket stables to travel faster, they start suspecting a spy in their ranks. They consider Nerol as the most likely suspect, and feed him false information about where they are going as they double back to the West. When they reach the pass and find it, too, blocked. Nerol complains about their incompetence, as they've gone the wrong way. If Nerol *was* the spy, then the false information did not fool him in the very first place.

The delaying is buying Lord Grellen time to consolidate the lords and crush the rebellion, and they resolve to make it there soon. 

Theriad suggests splitting the group up, and Lorim backs him. Jason travels with the main documents and important goods along with a smaller group of four soldiers, and the forty others go as a distraction to a different area. They do not inform Nerol or any of the others where Jason is going.

Jason's group is still blocked, but the larger group gets through. Jason suspects one of his four men to be the spy, deciding that to be far more likely, and learns their names: Heskor, Zaron, Velos, and Arkesh. 

Theriad has a vision again of Elara. Duthrim guides the group to one of Kael's hideouts. 

Theriad speaks in delirium with Lorim, thinking her to be Elara for a moment, begging her to forgive him for failing her. When his vision ends, he is embarrassed, and that he owes her one for the trouble, which she says she'll remember.

Via sending stone, Jason, Kael, and King Ravol coordinate. The larger Neroshi force is nearly arriving at this point. They coordinate a flanking ambush.

Jason gives a great speech before the men, foretelling the death of their enemies, seeming prophetic.

Jason attacks with the army through the pass, at a disadvantage, since the enemy controls the pass. Kael leads a his own rebels in a sudden and silent strike from behind. Duthrim and Theriad join this fray, and Duthrim orders Lorim to stay behind, not wanting her to see him this way, Theriad intending to stay behind and cast spells. Lorim joins with Theriad, using up her favour to follow, and Theriad insists she stays behind with him.

Theriad is unable to cast anything. When the a small force strike at the back ranks and at Lorim, he cannot use magic to defend her. The two work together and fight off the small force.

Lorim witnesses Duthrim's brutality again. The way he fights with his hammer, the way he trained in his days as a Rhakzaz, as an outsider, a bounty-hunter She speaks to Theriad about it, not about any fear of him, for she trusts her husband Duthrim fully, but rather sorrow for the pain of the past he has been bearing, for the burden he never shared.

Under this flanking, the inflict significant casualties on the legion before Baron Raxen can give any orders. He is captured before he can coordinate a retreat. The battle ends soon, with the legion falling to Neroshi forces. During the battle, Jason is recognised, and the enemies call him the Whist as they flee.

Duthrim is ashamed when he sees Lorim saw him fight, but she says nothing and merely tends to his wounds.

Thus Baron Raxen, one of the twelve Sonorous Lords, was captured.

Neros has formally declared war on the Sonorous Dominion. Neroshi forces establish a base at the pass that was captured. This pass is known now as the Gate of Dawn. Velos and Zaron both fell in the battle, and Jason sends back the other two soldiers to their homes, honorably discharging them, Heskor, and Arkesh, and tells Kael that the spy is certainly gone from their group, that may have been traitors. Kael took his loyal soldiers along with Theriad, Lorim, Duthrim, Jason, and Nerol towards his hidden main base of operations.
