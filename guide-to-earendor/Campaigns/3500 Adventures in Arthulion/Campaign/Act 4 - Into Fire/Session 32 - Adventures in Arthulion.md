Rethen's forces do not return. Janvar and Galor discuss plans of attack and begin a march. They march down the mountain and then head South. Tevell contaminates the water supply heading in their directions, sending messages ahead to warn the towns and his complex irrigation system allowing it to not affect the people he rules. They are turned away from most towns, who seem to support Lord Tevell. They are forced establish a much more involved supply chain to bring water back, and it suffers constant small attacks. As they are considering what to do about it, Tevell's forces manage a main strike at the main contingent. They are nearly scattered but Janvar manages to stay cool and put together a coordinated retreat. 

To avoid the towns and haggling with water, they run their supply line around the foothills on the mountain, and march their army through the dry brush there. They judge Tevell is not willing to set it all a-fire at risk of his people.

They are met with a large contingent of Tevell's forces, and told to retreat after a parlay with Tevell, where Tevell states he will burn them. They call his bluff and attack and Tevell's forces retreat. As they press their advantage, they are lured near a river bed and they are beset with a rain of fire arrows. Soon everything is on fire. The enemy troops have escaped. 

Janvar is struck. Janvar's chosen honor guard gets Janvar out. Theriad, unable to channel his own magic, guides the battle-mages in aid. But the battle is a disaster. Galor dies in this onslaught. Duthrim leads a team of engineers to breech a levy in the irrigation system to try to control the fires but is struck in the process. There is an attempt to rally behind a banner that is quickly shut down by arrows. Lorim sees this chaos and takes charge, organising much of the retreat, and saving her husband. The force is very much routed. Miranjen and the twins slaughter Janvar's guard and try to convince him to join them. He attacks her and she bests him easily, but spares his life, leaving him wounded in the dust. Theriad tries again to channel Nebelum, certain he will fail, and indeed gets nothing. 

Lord Rethen's forces reinforce Lord Vorqet's in the West, carving up the Noloric lands and forces. Lords Sernech, Grellan, and Vorn manage the war against the Sol'kas rather successfully. 

Janvar realises he has to draw out Tevell and plans to use Tevell's caring for his people. His soldiers march onto towns and begin burning fields. This does draw out Tevell and his forces and they do quick strikes. Taking his generals, his supply lines Many protest, but they are low in numbers.

This does bring out Tevell. And it leads to some success. But it is not sustainable, their numbers are too low and Tevell too clever and careful. Tevell at first tries to parlay, but quickly gives up on peace and his forces become more deadly, more offensive. For weeks the war becomes a game of raids and counter-raids. Tevell always seems a step ahead, turning traps into feints. Several times Janvar sees Miranjen among the enemies. They hear of the pillaging and raping done by Lords Rethen and Vorqet as they destroy Nolorei, and they respond in kind. 

Duthrim gets caught up in this fighting, to Lorim's displeasure. After long conversation, Lorim convinces Duthrim, who is consumed by shame, and he abstains, along with a group of people, angering Janvar. These become known as the *Rhakzu* (Outsiders) party, as they are led by Duthrim Illern, half-Sonorous, and such people were called *Rhakzaz*. They hold a tenous alliance with Janvar. He refuses to acknowledge them as a party. The friendship erodes. The Outsiders leave the fortress, setting up a large encampment some miles away. Theriad leaves with them. 

Tevell manages to outplay Janvar and lay siege to the pass. Janvar prepares his soldiers to exit via a secret passageway and to draw him away as he has before, attacking civilians, Tevell knows about the pass and is awaiting him. The battle is fierce. Miranjen and the twins show up, and Janvar is captured.

Messages are sent to the Outsiders, both by Tevell, and by Janvar's rebellion, now dubbing themselves The Whists. It turns out Janvar never unnamed Lorim and Duthrim from being his successors, and they are placed in charge of The Whists. At their orders, the Korr brothers are released. Together they create a new strategy and successfully defeat Tevell, who had anticipated the Outsiders might join him, and who is forced back into his valley. Theriad personally goes and rescues Janvar against Duthrim's orders, claiming that Jason is still in there somewhere.

The Korr brothers refuse Janvar's leadership, and leave with a portion of the rebellion forces to join the Outsiders. 

This drawn out stalemate lasts for months and leads nowhere. The burned fields, all these fights, just before harvest and winter, lead to a deep and unforgiving winter without food. It gets harder and harder to get food. Hesta dies in this time. The Whists and Outsiders half-reconcile, agreeing to stay together during the winter in order work together to not die of starvation.

The war slows down as winter falls. Without much food in the valley, The Rebellion stops supplies of food from coming in, Tevell's people are starving. The rebels are barely getting by. Intercepted messages reveal the other lords refuse to help Tevell, as they are busy with their own conquering, and have a mentality of each for their own. Tevell reaches out to the rebellion again to negotiate and discuss surrender.
