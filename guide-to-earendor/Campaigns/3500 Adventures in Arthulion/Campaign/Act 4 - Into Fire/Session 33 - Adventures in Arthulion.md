They negotiate a surrender thus allow food to be brought in. Tevell swears fealty and bends the knee provided Janvar agrees to terms on warring honourably, and ending the suffering of the citizens and insists they 'rescue' his twins if he is to bend the knee. It is now confirmed that the two twins that follow Miranjen around are Janvar's uncles, Tevell's sons. Many still are suffering. Tevell is furious that they burnt the fields without a way to feed the people, and deeply dislikes his grandson, considering him reckless, selfish, and a poor leader. 

Janvar is regretful, realising now the problem. Beyond this, while the Neroshi pressure on the north prevents the Dominion from sparing any troops they have up there, Lord Ghifarn has successfully blocked more Neroshi reinforcements from making their way south to the rebellion. The Neroshi did kill Lord Drogen before this stalemate occurred. Lords Rethen and Vorqet are busy tearing up the West. Reports claim Lord Grellan and Vorn are nearly returned from the invasion of Sol'kaz, leaving Sernech as an occupying force. 

Janvar sends messages to other lords and declares himself the Lord Naiyar, and the new High Lord, offering them mercy if they bend the knee to him. Lord Vorn, claiming to do it out of friendship to his father, accepts his claim, though it Janvar knows Vorn to act ever in self interest, and guesses it may be because he wishes to keep his title when Janvar wins. Vorn speaks to Qivern in the dungeons and convinces him to bend the knee as well.

Janvar schedules Raxen for execution after the war, as he does not bend the knee.

Theriad and Tevell discuss philosophy and war. Theriad tells Tevell about his own troubles with Nebelum and the conflict between his service to the god and the people around him. Tevell asks why he had ever served the god, asks where the doubt had crept in from. They have a long conversation and Tevell shows Theriad that he kept a secret library of books, preserving as many as he could, sealed in vaults beneath his keep. Tevell admits it is treason to the dominion, but that allowing them to be destroyed would be a treason to the people and to himself.

Janvar speaks with Duthrim and Lorim, not as Jason, in a meeting between friends, but as Janvar in a formal meeting between the leaders of the two factions. They speak about Janvar's behaviour, about the Korr brothers. Duthrim and Lorim refuse to bend the knee to their friend, and refusing to fully reconcile the Whists and the Outsiders, trying to talk him down from this path. Lorim threatens Janvar, daring him to schedule their execution too, telling Janvar that he is simply becoming the next tyrant. Duthrim tries to coax his old friend Jason back out of Janvar to little avail. This leads to the end of the alliance between the Outsiders and Whists. 

The Outsiders head South. Theriad wishes to go with them, but feels that his duty to Nebelum gives him a duty to remain with Tevell and study the saved books.

In the subsequent council of the Whists, the lords begin calling Janvar with the new name Janspet. Janvar thinks it a step too far and nips it in the bud. It shakes him more than anything else and brings out Jason once again. Jason speaks to Theriad of his regrets and Theriad tries to convince him to do the right thing. Theriad suggests Jason go to Tevell for wisdom.

Jason struggles between his two identities as Janvar and Jason as he begins to talk to Tevell.

Four days after this Miranjen shows up and tries to kill Tevell and destroy the books. Janvar protects his grandfather. Theriad chooses to fight her, reflexively following Janvar's orders, but fails to save a lot of the books because he is focused on stopping her. He notices Hesta's works among the salvaged books in an aisle he hadn't reached, and it shakes him out of the orders. He does manage to save a copy of Hesta's works, but allows Miranjen to get away to do so. Nebelum is disappointed he didn't save more, and focused on fighting over saving, but glad he did choose to save. This for the first time realigns Theriad's perspective. Preservation vs destruction instead of people vs knowledge. He has to protect all. He is left pondering this. 

Janvar is furious at Theriad. Tevell defends Theriad. In secret, Tevell agrees that Theriad should leave the Whists, saving the library. Tevell shows Theriad the Holder, or pocket-stable. Dominion technology to move large amounts of troops quickly in a pocket dimension, which being studied way back during the Rokan Rebellion, developed by Tevell's own engineers, and has him move the library into one of these. Tevell explains the constructions are temporary and unstable in long term. If sustaining life it can hardly survive longer than a few minutes, which is why they did not keep them in one of the pocket-stables before, and why the troops do not consistently move via them. Theriad recognizes this as similar research to what he had been researching in the Clockwork Citadel, but with different approaches. Tevell's research, combined with his own, helps him stabilise the spell and has a breakthrough with the physics and mathematics of his own teleportation spells. Theriad wonders about recreating the implosion experiment with these, which Tevell admits to have been a problem in its early development, but solved.

Duthrim and Lorim head South with the Outsiders and launch a quick and effective strike against Lord Sernech. The pair of them speak about what they want and returning with the kids, as it has been months, and they are likely safe from the dominion. They step down from leadership, allowing the Korr brothers to take over, but remain in the council.

Janvar leads a surgical strike for the capture of the twins, Lord Hadvar Tevell's sons. Shortly after, the two fall deeply ill. Janvar immediately shuts down the entire fortress, not allowing anyone in or out. Theriad had been planning to leave that day, and is thwarted by this. The two of them recognize the symptoms of the poison as being the same poison that killed Elara. Jason and Theriad work together and manage to save Levar, though Navar dies. Hadvar is very grateful to them for saving his son, and grieves Navar. A lucid Levar explains Miranjen snuck in and poisoned the two of them, and vows revenge.

Recognising Miranjen is likely trapped, Janvar and Levar try to find her. They find her posing as one of Lord Nerol's servants. When they try to get her, Lord Nerol stalls for time, and then orders his guard to kill the two of them, revealing his treachery. Lord Tevell arrives with some forces, having suspected Nerol already. Miranjen tries to get away in the confusion, and the two chase her.

The battle ends up tall in the battlements. Tevell arrives after having captured Nerol's men, just in time to see Levar allow himself to be impaled by her sword in order to take it from her, so that Janvar is able to knock her off the battlements. Janvar hesitates, but in the end Jason shoves her.

Janvar rushes to her side as she lays dying. They admit their undying love and hatred to each other, but she holds staunch in the belief that she was in the right and he was in the wrong, and refuses to believe he actually cares about others as she dies. 

Lord Tevell grieves his son and locks himself up in a tower. Theriad leaves, taking the library with him to the Outsiders.

All this combined shatters Janvar, who cannot bear to be Janvar, and Jason nearly steps down from the Whists. Jason unschedules the execution of Raxen and resolves to not take lordship in the end. Janvar resolves to not take lordship in the end, and to make sure the rebellion is for the people. He sends messages, as Jason, to Duthrim and Lorim. He changes much of the laws he had imposed for the captured lords.

Theriad arrives to the Outsiders. Sernech refuses to surrender. Learning more about the Outsiders, he decides to use Jason's tactics. Duthrim and Lorim receive reports that the cities are burning. They recognise they cannot save everyone at once on their own, and convince Korr to call for the Whists, that they are changed.
