*Act 4: Into Fire was meant to be the campaign finale, as Real Life Reasons meant that the original players for Lorim, Duthrim, and Theriad were unlikely to be able to continue in-person sessions. Session 35 was planned as our final session, but it was not a regular session, but rather us coming up with a bit of what the "Happily Ever After" was going to look like. Jason;s player did not participate here because he was planning to continue as Jason in a new campaign with some other friends, which unfortunately never materialized due to schedule issues. This was the meta reason Jason did not forgive Lorim and also did not return to academia with Theriad.*

*I did write a few of the things we talked about as a series of [[Short Stories - Adventures in Arthulion|short stories]]. And some of the players were inspired to do some of their own.*
