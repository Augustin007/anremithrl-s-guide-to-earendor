*After about two years, we eventually decided to continue online, with a twenty year gap in-game, and formalized a lot more of the intervening things. We had a session 36 where we planned the next act some more. We also had to figure out what drew the people out of "retirement" so to speak. We wrote a few things that would later be added to the [[Short Stories - Adventures in Arthulion|short stories]], and retconned a few things as well to make them fit. Writing out the [[Short Stories - Adventures in Arthulion#The Harri Contract|The Harri Contract]] and beyond.*
