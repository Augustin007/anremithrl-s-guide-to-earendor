Miyatol, feeling out of place at orientation, trying desperately to follow rules, sees "a boy wearing secondhand robes, carrying only a single satchel, with a posture that screams confidence." (From notes). Miyatol feels more confident talking to him. This is Richard. At first interaction, Richard seems arrogant, but he backs it up with a lot of knowledge.
They talk a bit, and Miyatol earns Richard's respect. They talk about not having tutors or books like other but instead learning from "stolen notes and half-burned scrolls".
They become friends quickly, both bonding over poorer upbringings in small villages. Richard's father was a miner, and his mother was dead. Miyatol's father was a village guard, and his mother knew something of medicine and acted sort of like the village healer, but she was never formerly trained and hardly ever paid. Small villages.

Through the crowd, a group of impeccably dressed students walks through the orientation hall like they own it. At the center—Narnor Azerim. 
Narnor is attended by her group of 'friends', people who she knows only follow her for her wealth, beauty, and political power.
She trades insults with Elira. Her group passes by Richard and Miyatol, and one of the highborn nobles, the son of some Nerosean lord bumps into Miyatol. While Miyatol is a bit annoyed, he does nothing. Richard stands up for his friend against this group. They barely pay him any mind and Narnor casually belittles him as they pass by. Miyatol and Richard take a disliking to Narnor and her group.

Stoic and Daedroy arrive late, much to Daedroy's consternation. They had agreed to go together, and Stoic had made him end up late. He wants to ditch orientation after signing in, annoying Daedroy who was late _specifically_ because he was going to attend with Stoic as per their agreement. 

Stoic thinks they should ditch the boring part of orientation, sneak into the alchemy labs.

They watch Narnor's group pass by, and don't think much of it.

Headmaster's speech. A thing I actually wrote. 

Seperated into groups for tour, given schedules and whatnot. Glided past most of this into the next section, where they go to "The Bazaar", a nicknamed area where booths for fraternities, societies, groups, clubs, and whatnot all have booths.
Richard is irritated when a professor challenges whether he'll "live up to \[his] test scores."

Miyatol seems intrigued by the dueling booth, but seems loathe to leave Richard and too shy to say anything. Richard notices this and walks right up and signs up to the dueling club. Miyatol hesitates, but Richard gives him the confidence he needs. There they meet upperclassman Ganya Al'foson, the leader of the club.

Daedroy drags Stoic toward the Medical Fraternity booth, much to Stoic’s visible boredom. They meet Serik Velgain, an upperclassman. 
Serik mocks Stoic, disliking his lack of seriousness.
Daedroy and Serik gain some modicum of respect for each other, and Serik offers to help Daedroy if he ever needs anything.

Stoic eventually ducks away and attempts to join the Evocation Society, but is turned aside by Leris Harvian, who mans the booth, because he's not taking things seriously. Richard, also in line, is turned aside as well, because he's poor. Richard argues with Leris as Stoic leaves. Narnor's group arrives at about this point and Leris easily lets her sign up, bantering, to Richard's anger. Miyatol pulls him away from the booth, scared of Richard causing a ruckus and getting himself kicked out.

Eventually they return to their dorms.

Closing scene. 

Richard, alone in his dorm, disoriented by the wealth of it all. Distracted by his hurt pride with his interactions with Narnor's group, determined to make them respect him. Trying to push that aside and study, his half-elven heritage enabling him to stay up all night. Slivers of worries finally making their way in.

Miyatol feeling cramped, watching his other two roomates get along. Finds a note from his father. "_You are meant for more than this village, Miyatol. Do not let them tell you otherwise._" He can't relax.

Narnor feels empty once the rush of popularity fades and she's back on her own. She looks down from her suite and can see Richard down in the scholarship suite, hunched over his books. She marvels at continuing to run into him. Her servants call her away, having drawn a bath for her. She turns away from the window.

Daedroy watches as Stoic throws his coat onto a chair, kicks his boots off, and collapses onto his bed without a care. He asks Stoic if he's even looked at his schedule. Stoic hasn't, and doesn't care.
