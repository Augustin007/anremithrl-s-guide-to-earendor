Session XXVI: Missing Spear and Dwarven Danger
- Nugget insults several dwarves and gets kicked out of several taverns as he spends more and more of his coin on drink. Eventually he passes out in an alleyway.
- He wakes up, his belongings stolen.
- Nugget tries to enlist a fellow dragonborn to help him fight, but is met with confusion. He tries to appeal to the hatred between dragonborn and dwarves.
- He catches a dwarf with his spear and attacks him. He is stopped by the locals and nearly arrested, but runs away. 
- William finds him. Regrouping with Greg, PINE-APL, Lady Black, the five storm the thieves' apartment. They are nearly bested.
- Colossus is buying a big goodmead hat, luaus, and other gifts for everyone, not knowing what's going on.
- PINE-APL contacts Colossus, who begins rushing across the city.
Without waiting for Collosus, the group decided to attack the dwarves themselves. Jess picked the lock on the window, and William climbed in. However, he was immediately defenestrated as the dwarves were ready for them. One of the dwarves was shooting at them from the window while the other attacked from the shadows.

William spotted the hidden attacker, but was unable to fight because he had just fallen out of a window. Jess fought off the rogue, and PINE-APL kills him by heating up his armour and crushing his head. But Jess was shot by a dart from the other dwarf above. Just when it seemed like Jess was about to die, Collosus arrived in time and used a powerful spell to save her, exhausting himself in the process.
- Police arrive.
