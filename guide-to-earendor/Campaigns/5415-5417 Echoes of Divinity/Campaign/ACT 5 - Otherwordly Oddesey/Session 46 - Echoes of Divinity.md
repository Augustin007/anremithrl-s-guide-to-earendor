Session XLVI - Chaotic Realms
- As the party continues on their journey, they are met with strange sights and experiences that defy logic and reason. Water flows like solid ground, while solid ground flows like water, and a sign that controls gravity. They even come across an ocean where birds swim upside down underwater, and fish float upside down in the air, causing the group to question their own perceptions.
- Illusions seem to meld with reality, becoming more and more difficult to traverse.
- The party reaches a city named Lavore.
