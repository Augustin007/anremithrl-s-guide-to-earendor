Session LV: The fight
- Tal'berius shows up and confronts her. She's incredibly old, but her mortal mind was never meant to comprehend all of this. After a brief fight, the party sides against Tal'berius. They barely manage to handle one of his Taxblades as Tal'berius flees. They chase after him. Nugget meets with me and she gives him the necklace and guides him to a hallway.
