William enters the hall of Noab

Session 2 begins with the discussions between William, Galio, and Noab. Noab asks about whether William intends to continue to ship goods to Golin, and William says that he is willing to if he can secure an exclusivity deal. Shipments that are not his have to be taxed more heavily when going through Golin. He speaks to Galio about a similar deal with Solenthir, but Galio cannot make such a deal on his King Aukun's behalf, and besides, nothing _can get_ to Solenthir, at the moment. It is too far north, and the open Deathwood pass is in the dragonborn territories, and the Aldarkeep pass has long been held by Auril.

William lets slip that he knows more about Auril than others, because he was at the Tree of Names three years before, and curiosity piqued, he tells them that Colossus was there too, and that they were on a mission for King Idros, whose kingdom fell to Auril and who is no more. They confirm he is telling the truth with a Zone of Truth cast by Noab's Sorcerer Airon Boodwine of Azerim.

Meanwhile, in Gnomes'helm, Colossus is busy trying to muster food and supplies together, but there is nor much left of either. He realises they will be out of food within months, despite all their preparation. 

When William returns from his dealings with Golin a month later, Colossus gladly signs the exclusivity deals, and agrees also to let William purchase land on which to build a warehouse and a general base for shipping, giving jobs to the population of gnomshelm.

Galio invites Colossus into the NAF, and Colossus joins. Colossus sorrowfully leaves his people as he joins this new quest, leaving in his place the circle of advisors. As they head to the north, William tries to get a deal with the Nerosean consulate, which allow it. The Nerosean consulate had refused to join the NAF.

On his way to Aldarkeep, Galio makes plans for how he will keep it safe on maps, but his great great grandfather's ghost makes him question every plan, and he begins to lose his confidence and doesn't sleep very well.

All the same, with a small force of 2000 and surprise, Galio is able to swiftly take Chokepoint Zeta (Aldarkeep Pass), Galio himself singlehandedly defeats the three dangerous spellcasters, members of the order known as the Sons of Auril. (These three casters had, in the previous campaign, caused much grief to the party, and killed Padfoot when the party tried to take them out.) Colossus is gravely injured in this battle.

William arrives at Chokepoint Zeta shortly afterwards.
