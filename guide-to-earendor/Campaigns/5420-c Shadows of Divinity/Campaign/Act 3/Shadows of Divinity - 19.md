16th Hammer
William passes out as Halt scolds him for letting the Eye get away, not sleeping, and his sloppiness in killing Tahlia. He sleeps on board 
the ships on his way to the Tree of Names, talking with Valus and Halt about what will need to be done, and spends the day attempting to identify the weapons.

8th-10th Hammer
Faust speaks with Morgana overlooking the soldiers as they steal food to eat after getting uncursed by the fairy. 

Faust tries to convince her to cause chaos, but she is scared to cause harm to the soldiers, innocent. He notices her attachment to the carved horse that Lucy gave her. He tries to take her horse, and Morgana gets quite angry, so much so she agrees to cause chaos on the soldiers, but her mood and look are affected, and her sanity seems on edge, Faust is enchanted by the horse and lets her off the hook about it. He stops her from causing chaos with the soldiers, having lost his taste for the chaos because of how deeply unnerved he is. They eventually leave, going north towards the tree, on the way they talk about morality, and she is convinced to cause chaos. They reach the edge of the Lake of Sanctuary, approaching from the around the South-South-East, so that they come upon Tormac, the dragon.
