Vecna knocks out Colossus. Nugget buys the remaining time while the scouts destroy the source. The undead are still running. Recognising the retreat of the dark regions, and the slow return of her power, Araushnee intends to do a god-leveled turn undead to destroy the army, but it would kill Nugget too. He accepts his death.

Colossus and Tyr plane shift back to the material plane and talk with William.

Baron Daron dies of a heart attack. The Analyst drinks himself into oblivion in Baron Daron's tent. They hold a small funeral.

William talks again with Qarr, the IFCC, Baal'zebub, and  Asmodeus. Gallio returns from Mirai. Tyr warns William about Xandred and the Stellatite Mines. Colossus notices Tyr's nullmetal. They remove peircings from everyone in the army.

Krag destroys the door of the Frostmourne and sees Liriel and Auril. Liriel recognises him. Liriel tries to convince Krag that Auril is not evil. Tries to convince Auril that Krag means no harm. Auril mostly seems amused. When Krag attacks her, Liriel tries to break them apart as the two start fighting, to little avail. Her efforts frustrate Auril who tries to kill her, but Krag saves Liriel. Krag breaks off Auril's horns before being vaporised. The doorframe falls, cracking the floor, drowning out Liriel's screams.

The attack begins. Talberius gives William spellshot. William tries to shoot Auril twice. They fire on the advancing armies. Autil drops a meteor swarm on the command tent.
