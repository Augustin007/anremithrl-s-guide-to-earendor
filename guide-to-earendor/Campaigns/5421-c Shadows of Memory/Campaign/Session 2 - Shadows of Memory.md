Dr Aileen deliberately walks in on Richard to annoy him and prevent him from spending money so frivolously ever again. 

Dr Aileen spends some time trying to discover the latitude and longitude but is thwarted by the planet's movement. While Richard gets to know the town, he attempts to sell the Sheep's heads and soon thereafter his hair falls out due to interacting with them.

With Dr Aileen's help, he is able to sell 300 of them, 3 copper apiece, for a total of 9 gold pieces.

Aileen spends a gold piece buying a map, a sharpener, four pencils, a brush-pen and inkwell, three pens, a geometric compass, and a 100-page notebook, paying more than necessary, (Total cost 8 silver and 2 copper)

Richard meanwhile goes to the blacksmith.

Notes: Richard is allergic to cats, Aileen is slightly deaf in his right ear

TODO: Get survival kit, weapons, and glassblowers. Scientific equipment to run experiments. Rune Chalk.
