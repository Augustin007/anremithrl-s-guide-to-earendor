_Let it be known, written, recorded, and sealed beneath witness, oath, and chain, that this Covenant is struck between the Mortal Sovereign of the Land (hereafter “the Signatory”) and Beelzebub, Lord of Flies, Sovereign of Corruption, and Infernal Regent of Rot, under the Immutable Laws of the Old Pact and the Chains of Nessus, and in the sight of those Powers who yet preside over Concord and Binding._

## **PREAMBLE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

The Signatory acknowledges:
- That all bargains made with the Archdukes of Hell are binding unto eternity unless specifically released by the Archduke himself.
- That all terms herein shall be interpreted according to Infernal Law and not Mortal Custom, and that precedence shall be given to the Letter above the Spirit.
- That any silence, omission, or ambiguity in this Compact shall redound to the benefit of Beelzebub and not to the Signatory, for silence is itself a clause in Hell.
- That the Chains of Nessus, having borne witness to countless bargains since the Sundering War, shall serve as ultimate arbiter.
- That, in consideration of the benefits offered to the Signatory, the price and obligations described hereafter are just, equitable, and without recourse.

## **THE PROMISES OF BEELZEBUB**

### **On Faust**
Beelzebub, under ancient oaths, shall effect the _removal_ of the demigod Faust.
- _Removal_ shall be defined as the displacement of Faust from the lands of the Signatory in such fashion as Beelzebub deems sufficient.
- The form of this removal may be banishment, distraction, enthrallment, relocation, imprisonment, obliteration, or any other method lawful under Infernal precedent.
- Should Faust continue to trouble the Signatory _indirectly_—through consequence, allies, or cascading acts—this shall not constitute breach, for Hell holds no obligation against circumstance.
- Should Faust return by fate, prophecy, divine will, or self-resurrection, Beelzebub shall be held guiltless, for his removal was fulfilled in the hour of execution.

### **On Engines of Ruin**

Beelzebub shall deliver to the Signatory bombs of tenfold their present potency, each with a fifty-foot radius of assured devastation, and in number doubled from the Signatory’s current stock.
- These bombs shall be _more stable_, being attuned to the thought of the rightful bearer.
- _Rightful bearer_ shall mean the possessor at the moment of detonation, not the possessor at the moment of gift. Thus, weapons taken, stolen, bargained, or claimed by right of arms may be detonated without constraint.
- Beelzebub makes no warranty that stray or unbidden thoughts, dreams, or unconscious desires shall not suffice to trigger the bombs. Such is the burden of power.
- The bombs are instruments of Hell’s making. To use them is to accept responsibility for their effects, intended or otherwise, and to admit no claim against Beelzebub or his House.

### **On Rings of Fortune**

Beelzebub shall bestow ten rings, each enchanted with a random _beneficial_ effect.
- _Beneficial_ shall be defined according to cosmic balance, not mortal desire. An effect that increases might while shortening lifespan, that grants foresight while ensuring despair, or that aids the world while costing the bearer, shall yet be deemed beneficial.
- Effects may alter at the turning of seasons, the passage of moons, or the whim of Fate, and such alterations shall not constitute fraud but Fortune.
- Should multiple rings be worn together, interactions are outside Infernal guarantee; boons may amplify, negate, or corrupt each other.
- Should a ring’s bearer be unworthy in Hell’s judgment, the boon may instead manifest to their descendants, enemies, or the realm itself.

### **On Gauntlets of Might**

The Signatory shall be gifted enchanted gauntlets conferring Combat Prowess and the touch of High Magic.
- Such boons shall persist until revoked by their lawful owner, Beelzebub, should the Signatory falter in duty.
- Should the gauntlets be destroyed, their essence shall flow back to Beelzebub, and he may reforge them as he pleases, whether for or against the Signatory.
- Should the Signatory perish in battle with the gauntlets, the soul shall be bound to them, carried with them, and presented to Beelzebub for judgment.

## **THE RIGHTS OF BEELZEBUB**

### **On Jurisdiction**

Beelzebub is granted eternal jurisdiction over the Lake and the Conduit therein.
- All waters, currents, vapors, energies, and essences that pass through, within, or from the Lake are his, whether tangible or ethereal.
- Jurisdiction persists in perpetuity and cannot be ceded by abandonment, silence, or lapse. Once claimed, always claimed.
- Any mortal, immortal, or planar entity drawing from the Lake henceforth owes tithe to Beelzebub, to be exacted at a time of his choosing.

### **On Contracts Broken**

The Signatory binds themselves to annul the contract between the IFCC and Aka’vral within seven days of this Compact.
- Should this annulment fail, Aka’vral must be removed from alliances, politics, and interests of Drakenthorne in substance and appearance.
- Should this too fail, Beelzebub inherits full jurisdiction to accomplish the task by any means. This includes the conscription of the Signatory’s allies, wealth, and bloodline.    
- Any delay or resistance by the Signatory shall be counted as treachery, voiding protections granted elsewhere in this Compact.

---

## **UPON COMPACT BROKEN**

If the Signatory fails in any obligation:
- Beelzebub shall inherit immediate authority over all the Signatory’s lands, subjects, goods, and progeny until the breach is remedied.
- The Signatory’s soul shall pass into collateral service, not to be released until a term of ten thousand years is fulfilled or until Beelzebub grows weary of its use.
- Any resistance or refusal shall be met with lawful escalation, including damnation of lineage and retroactive nullification of mortal protections.

## **GENERAL CLAUSES**

**Secrecy of Binding**  
The Signatory may not disclose the existence or contents of this Compact to any divine, celestial, or arbiter unbound to Hell. To do so renders the Compact broken and the Signatory’s soul immediately forfeit. _Disclosure_ includes intentional speech, unintentional admission, or discovery through negligence.

**Interpretive Authority**  
All disputes of language, meaning, or execution shall be judged by Beelzebub or his duly appointed servants. Their judgment is final, binding, and without appeal.

**Subordination of Mortal Law**  
No mortal law, custom, or precedent may void or amend this Compact. Should mortal rulers, councils, or churches forbid the terms, the Signatory shall be deemed traitor to them, not to Beelzebub.

**On Collateral Duties**  
The Signatory agrees to render reasonable aid to Beelzebub or his agents when called upon, provided such aid does not directly contradict the explicit clauses herein. Refusal shall be deemed breach.

**Termination**  
This Compact persists until obligations are fulfilled. Should the Signatory die before such time, Beelzebub retains all rights herein, and the soul shall be bound until Hell releases it. Should the Signatory reincarnate, resurrect, or be restored, the Compact reattaches automatically.

**Witness of Law**  
This Compact is witnessed, chained, and sealed by the Chains of Nessus, and any attempt to revoke or alter its clauses without Infernal consent is void. Punishment shall fall upon the Signatory, their heirs, and their companions.
