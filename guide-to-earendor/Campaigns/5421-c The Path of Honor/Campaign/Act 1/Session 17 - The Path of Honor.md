Talor Internal Injury

Talor and Torquil talk about Caxius's death, and continue to try to find their bearings. Eventually, they find Drithen and Uncim, a pair of prisoners with a little more free run of the prison and a more remote cell block. They help the two escape, exchanging drugs, and attack a pair of guards they encounter along the way.

Liriel and Naras travel through the city, eventually meeting Ivvan.
