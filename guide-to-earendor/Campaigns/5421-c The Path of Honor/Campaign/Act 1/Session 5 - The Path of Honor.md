Syl returns to look for Ahktos and manages to find him. Naras, Talor, and four rangers follow Syl and attempt to ambush Voren. Voren talks to the others and has Ahktos under a mind-control spell so that they don't suspect he switched sides. He channels through Ahktos as he teleports away. Talor and Naras are confused into fighting each other through illusion and mist, the rangers are also fighting amongst themselves. Syl posesses Ahktos to drive out Voren, and Ahktos manages to keep his secret.
The four rangers died during the battle.
To escape his oath, he changes his name to Torquil, supposedly out of shame for what he did under mind control (killing his friend, and killing the rangers.) 
They return to Gnomes'helm.

At Gnomes'helm, they purchase some goods and get some potions ready. Naras talks to Nanold about the slave trade in Golin and about the politics in the Shattered Region. Talor trades rations for a huge sword.

Syl reports the Intellect Devourer having consumed the small town and getting closer. The group lead it away and Torquil calls on Auril to freeze it at the bottom of a river. 

He blesses some water for Naras to use to recharge his Spell Spheres.
They reach Azerim.
