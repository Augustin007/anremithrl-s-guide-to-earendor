11/20

Tarnil, Qorneth, and Uldren make a grave for Talor, and loot what they can from the bandits. They reach Riulva and are greated by lord Aka'vral Tar'at'kyr, lord of Ruilva. 

They regroup and rest, replenish their equipment, and leave there the strange spherical gearbox from Tal'berius after it activates and petrifies one of the people inspecting it.

They travel south, where they are attacked by a strange necrotic force. It kills over half of their men before gunning straight for Tarnil, demanding the dagger of vengeance. Tarnil recognises her as the redhead travelling with the "bag blowers". When Tarnil doesn't have it, the force departs.
