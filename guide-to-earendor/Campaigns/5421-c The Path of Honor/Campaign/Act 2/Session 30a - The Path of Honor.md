As they are being shuffled around and their goods are being taken, Liriel obtains the Dagger of Vengeance from Naras and immediately escapes. Ivvan is caught, ransom is sent to Carabran and the Church of Lolth. Serin also tries to help, but is forced back into her shape by the slavers and is captured.

Aric wasn't bought alongside them and was taken away by the slavers to the next place.
