Aka'vral and Matthew begin travelling north from southern Riulva. A week in, they stop at the northernmost city of Riulva, Sup'tyu. Sup'tyu is a city-state in northern Riulva, ruled by Governer Quinn Crowe, as of the events of [[Crew of the Tyr]]. They purchase supplies for the small contingent of men and some pastries. Arthur buys Black-sourced Meth from Vye. Hearing rumours of Grel'zia's magic, Arthur decides he needs stronger weapons. Arthur decides to spend a lot of money to to buy Trinitrotoluene based explosive and place it along with Chlorine and Meth. calling it an Arthur Grenade. He buys a bag of holding to put these bombs in to mitigate the risk of their explosion as they ride.

They decide to cut through the Gral'thar, the endless wilds, marching up the Zal'thar path into the Impassable Mountains. They are attacked by Alana Anai, and her soldiers, sent by Grel'zia. Taelarden spots the ambush and they are not caught defenseless. Arthur attempts to use an Arthur Grenade, but the explosion is far more powerful than he'd assumed. It nearly kills everyone there, except Alana, Aka'vral, and Taelarden. Taelarden is revealed by his immortality. Taelarden does not kill Alana without being given a name, a wounded Aka'vral recovers, and kills Alana. They're able to save Arthur, but by the time they're sure he is stable and look to the other soldiers, its too late. The bury the dead. All the horses are gone as well. They move ahead and the three make a hidden camp.
