Aka'vral and Arthur send Taelarden to kill Grel'zia, using up the first of their names. Taelarden becomes Alana and swiftly tracks down Grelzia's outpost and sneaks in. Meanwhile Aka'vral and Arthur head up and reach Xyrdakul. After some credentials, the Ekenites inform Beelzebub of Aka'vral and Arthur's arrival. The two are sent to meet with Beelzebub, who offers them a deal.
