Language of Cherhal: Chersai

Cherhal, a warlike nation in the far southern reaches near Echoriati and Chiss, has developed a language as harsh and efficient as its militaristic culture and brutal institutions. The people of Cherhal prize dominance, unwavering order, and loyalty—values baked into the structure of Chersai, their common tongue.

## 1. Phonology & Pronunciation

Consonants:

- Stops/Affricates: p, t, k, (q)*, b, d, g
- Fricatives: f, s, sh, kh, h
- Nasals: m, n
- Liquids: l, r
- Glides: w, y

*(q) is a uvular stop, produced far back in the mouth, giving some words a harsh, guttural quality.

Vowels:

- Short: a, e, i, o, u
- Long: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū (when stressed or held longer)

Stress:

- Typically falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable.
- In words referencing high authority or strong emotion, Cherhali speakers often elongate the stressed vowel for emphasis (e.g., “Krā­tash!”—Victory!).

Phonotactics & Sound Feel:

- Clusters of consonants are common, reflecting Cherhal’s hard, quick, commanding style of speech: e.g., “Strak,” “Narkheth.”
- Harsh fricatives like “kh” (voiceless velar fricative) are frequent in words linked to conflict or aggression.

## 2. Writing System

Chersai uses a runic script carved historically on stone tablets and branding irons (for marking slaves). It consists of angular glyphs that are easily cut or chiseled. In modern times, it is also written with quills on parchment or leather, retaining the angular style.

## 3. Core Grammar

1. Word Order:
    
    - Predominant word order is SVO (Subject–Verb–Object), though for emphasis, Cherhali warriors often place the verb first in commanding speech (e.g., “Kill them” might appear as Kat sehal! or simply Kat!).
2. Nouns & Cases:
    
    - Nouns have a simplified case system, primarily nominative (subject) and object (direct object), marked by suffixes:
        - Nominative: no suffix (root form).
        - Object: _-en_ (attached to the end).
        - Example:
            - “Narkheth” (slave) → Narkheth (when subject), Narkhethēn (when object).
3. Gender & Number:
    
    - No strict grammatical gender in everyday usage.
    - Plural suffix: _-ash_ or _-esh_ if the noun ends in a vowel.
        - “Slave” (narkheth) → narkhethash (“slaves”).
4. Pronouns:
    
    - I / me: _zan_ (subject) / _zanen_ (object)
    - you (singular): _tol_ / _tolen_
    - he / she / they (singular): _or_ / _oren_
    - we / us: _zanash_ / _zanash-en_
    - you (plural): _tolash_ / _tolash-en_
    - they (plural): _orash_ / _orash-en_
5. Verbs & Conjugation:
    
    - Verbs typically end in _-t,_ _-k,_ or _-l_ in their infinitive: e.g., kat (“to kill”), strak (“to seize”), anol (“to serve”).
    - Present Tense is unmarked (infinitive form).
    - Past Tense: add _-a_ to the end (if the verb ends in a consonant) or _-da_ (if the verb ends in a vowel)
        - _kat_ → _kata_ (“killed”)
        - _anol_ → _anolda_ (“served”)
    - Imperative: The bare root is used with a raised or harsh tone: “Kat!” (“Kill!”).
    - Future Tense: preface the verb with mar (similar to “will” in Common): _mar kat_, _mar anol_, etc.
6. Adjectives & Adverbs:
    
    - Often placed after the noun or verb they modify: e.g., “Cherhal strong” = Cherhal ryt; “Fight fiercely” = ferr khat ryt.
    - Some common suffixes:
        - _-ryt_ for something strong or forceful,
        - _-nai_ for something honorable,
        - _-dre_ for something cursed or tainted.

1. Honorifics:
    
    - Rakh- used as a prefix for high nobility or war leaders. A “rakh” is effectively an overlord or warlord.

        - E.g., “Chal-Vala” might be an esteemed general.

    - Narkheth = “slave,” especially in formal references, a more direct term.
    - Dovr = “bond,” used to reference personal loyal servants who are not mere property but forcibly sworn for life.
    - Tashvar = “freeman” (someone who is under no bondage).
3. War & Conquest Phrases:
    
    - Krātash! = “Victory!” (exclamation, often used at the end of a successful raid/battle)
    - Rath orn! = “No mercy!” (literally “spare none!”)
    - Chorsha enek! = “Break them!” (a phrase used to demoralize the enemy)
4. Customary Greetings & Partings
