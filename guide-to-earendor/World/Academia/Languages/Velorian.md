## I. Introduction to Velorian Language

The Velorian language, often referred to as Neroshi-Velorian due to its close historical ties to the Neroshi trade dialect, is the dominant language spoken in the United Kingdom of Veloria (UKV). While it shares its roots with Neroshi, the Velorian variant has evolved distinctively over the centuries, shaped by its maritime culture, mercantile dominance, and deep academic traditions.

Velorian is a polysynthetic and analytical language, meaning it builds complex words through smaller root components while still relying on word order for meaning. It features a consonant-heavy structure with soft vowels, making it sound elegant and rhythmic, with a formal tone in writing but a clipped, efficient cadence in speech.

## II. Phonetics and Structure

- Syllable structure: Typically CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) or CV (Consonant-Vowel).
- Stress patterns: Primary stress falls on the first or second syllable of most words.
- Common consonants: L, R, S, T, K, V, D, P, F, N, Z
- Common vowels: A, E, O, I (U is less common and often found in loanwords).

Examples of phonetic shifts from ancient Neroshi:

- "Nerosh" (meaning "coin") became "Paros" in Velorian.
- "Ar'kesh" (meaning "seafarer") became "Arkesh".

## III. Writing System

Veloria retains an old script known as the Lorekeep Standard, a derivative of Neroshi glyphic writing, used in official documents and religious texts. However, modern Velorian uses a simplified alphabet, known as Velsai, which is phonetically based and structured for ease of trade and diplomacy.

- Velsai has 26 letters, with distinct characters for long and short vowels.
- Diacritics are used in formal writing to indicate tense and emphasis.
- Compound words are frequently used, especially in maritime terminology.

## IV. Grammar and Sentence Structure

Velorian follows a SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, with flexibility for poetic or formal speech.

- Tense Markers:
    
    - Past: -et (Example: Kel et = "I sailed.")
    - Present: -an (Example: Kel an = "I sail.")
    - Future: -ir (Example: Kel ir = "I will sail.")
- Plurality:
    
    - Regular plural: -i (Example: Faron → Faroni = "ships")
    - Honorific plural (used for respected entities): -aes (Example: Paros → Parosaes = "honored coins")
- Possession:
    
    - "Of" or "-'s" is indicated by na' before a noun.
    - Example: Kel na’ Veloria ("Ship of Veloria" / "Veloria’s ship").
