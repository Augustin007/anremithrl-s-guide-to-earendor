Marethyu was present before the creation of the Almost and the formation of the first Dawn. He shaped Elves and Men. He is forbidden by laws preceding the Almost to interfere with free will, and cannot offer gifts without consequences. These seem to be physical limitations moreso than personal limitations. He generally seems incapable of doing anything without an agreement, and seems incapable of violating his oaths or refusing to make an offer.

He is the sole source of non-quiddic true M-folds.

Marethyu was present when [[Arambar]] fell during the Eternal Wars. The sentience of the gods is a result of a final deal between Arambar and Marethyu.

Istishia and Tartarus each sought Marethyu’s aid during the Eternal Wars, but refused the price. 

He created Sigil at the behest of the [[Lady of Pain]] in exchange for her ability to communicate, cursing her to eternal loneliness.

He dislikes the [[Araushnee|Raven Queen]], and considers her as pretending to do his job[^1][^6], but still offered her a price for the ability to provide resurrections.[^6]

He aided in creating and maintaining the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Trees of Sanctuary]] in exchange for [[Thalorin]]'s wakefulness. 

He made a deal with [[Eleutheros]] in order to create the [[Feywild]] and protect the people, his nature prevented him from deferring the cost[^2], and Eleutheros claimed the cost was almost too high.[^3]

He once offered to cure [[Ashdilkir]], but she refused.[^4]

He granted [[Bechel of Bharam]] the Sight in exchange for her regular sight.

He granted [[Valus]] and his swordsmen immortality in exchange for their inability to use any form of magic.

He granted [[Koluss]] the ability to extend his mind over others in exchange for Koluss's daughter.

[[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] surprised him by somehow removing Marethyu's ability to make deals with him.

He restored [[Araushnee]]'s immortality in exchange for her champion [[Colossus Methunroa|Colossus]], and agreed to release the prisoners of [[Sigil]] in exchange for Colossus's life at the [[Trees of Sanctuary]]. This deal would let him kill the [[Lady of Pain]].[^1]

He granted the same gift he gave to Bechel of Sight for sight to [[Qorneth Nashol]].[^5]
