The Archduke Mammon is a lesser god who rose to notable rank during the Sundered War. He is a descendant of the Elohim. He married [[Tiamat]] and with her ruled [[Minauros]], one of the nine hells. 

During the Sundered War, he bribed leaders among men with promises of great riches if they would follow him.

He has generally chosen to show himself with a long beard and a wide smile on his face, sitting on a throne covered in gold coins. 

[[Isendra]] did not invite him to leave the nine hells with her.[^1]
