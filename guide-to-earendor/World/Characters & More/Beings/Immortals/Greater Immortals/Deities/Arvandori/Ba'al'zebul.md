Ba'al is one of the lords of the nine hells, ruling over Maladomini, the realm of politicians and liars. He took the name given to him in mockery, Lord of the Flies, and wears it proudly.

He is the patron of his descendent [[Ekenon]]. He and Ekenon manipulated the anarchists in Xyrdakul to help him move his layer of hell into Xyrdakul on the Longest Night.[^1]

He was approached by [[Aka'vral Tar'at'kyr]] and [[Arthur Thomas]] and offered them a deal, but they refused.[^2]
