Eleutheros was an elf and master illusionist. He was the younger brother of [[Lady Elmenore]]. 

He fought in [[The Sundering War]] 

During the Iron Reign, Eleutheros sought out [[Marethyu]] in order to make a deal to save his people. While Eleutheros did take the deal, and saved millions of lives, he was ashamed that the price was almost to high for him, as he had thought he was willing to give up anything for his people[^1].

He did end up taking this deal, and it caused the creation of the [[Feywild]], a world crafted of strong illusion beyond the reach of [[Hechilspet]]. His people became the Fey elves. Other creatures, particularly those suited to illusion, fled to the Feywild to escape the Iron Reign. This in particular includes Fae creatures like Faeries. Note the similar Fae/Fey root in reference to illusions.

The power that flowed through him ascended him to a status more akin to a minor deity. This turned him into the first Archfey, the result of a Feywild channeled ascension

A few years later, he fought, defeated, and captured Hechilspet in a great duel, locking him in a [[Hechilspet's Prison|Prison]].[^2]

He then spent much time travelling the world, often helping fellow travelers.

Because of the associated curse, he has familiarity with madness.

He soon accumulated a small following and began his ascension to greater godhood. From that, in the common tongue many call him Dionysus.

[[Tahlia Tormund]] owes the restoration of her sanity to him.

He took [[Jess Val|Lady Black]] as his apprentice in the year 5417 AA.[^1]

He travelled with her for the next three years.

He sent her to [[the Nine Hells]] and aided her from afar.[^2]

He rescued the prisoners of [[Sigil]] when they became lost in [[the Labyrinth of Insanity]] shortly after their escape.
