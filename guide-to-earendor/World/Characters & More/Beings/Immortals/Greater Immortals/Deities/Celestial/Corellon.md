Corellon is a Celestial who remained a member of the original [[Celestial Council]] and did not participate in the [[The Sundering War]]. Before the Sundering War he was known as the God of Arts and Crafts. He regrets not having stood with the [[Righteous Council]] during the war, as he was once beloved of the elves and spoke often with them. He watches the mortals closely, in particular the elves of the Taur, who remember him still.

He appeared in a vision to [[Elu Singollo]] when Elu was in [[Sigil]][^1].
