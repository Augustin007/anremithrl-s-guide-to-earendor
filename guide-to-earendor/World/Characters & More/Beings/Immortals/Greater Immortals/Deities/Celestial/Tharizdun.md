Tharizdun was always reckless and unbeholden to rules, reigned in only by his brothers [[Asmodeus]] and [[The Forgotten One]]. He was often impulsive and forgetful and had few friends. He was fond of violence and was a sadist. He was close with [[Acheron]].

He did not participate in most councils, though was not exiled as he was one of the Celestials. When the divine began creating a variety of mortals he liked to create beings to toy with them.

He aided in dragging the [[Araushnee|Raven Queen]] to [[The Nine Hells]], and spoke vehemently against mortals in the First Council of Unmaking. It was his vehemence which made clear to some that they were in the wrong, and likely decided the vote against them, and for that same reason Asmodeus barred him from attending the Second Council of Unmaking. 

He gathered to him the crueler gods who reveled in destruction and led them in the first assaults on the mortals. As the war evolved Tharizdun's followers fought alongside Asmodeus but undisciplined. They delighted in destruction for its own sake, horrified even their allies, and nearly unmade the Material Plane before [[Thalorin]] intervened.

He killed [[Varian]] in combat at Hatreth. He also created the disease that killed Nanor. He was met by [[Magnar]], [[Tal'berius Tarrilion|Tal'berius]], and [[Artorius]]. He succesfully killed Magnar and Artorius before Tal'berius was capable of carving his heart out and chaining him with the [[Chains of Law]]. 

Tal'berius kept his heart. It is still beating in his [[Architect's Sanctum]].[^1][^2][^3]

He remains chained in the Nine Hells, and his brother Asmodeus refuses to free him.
