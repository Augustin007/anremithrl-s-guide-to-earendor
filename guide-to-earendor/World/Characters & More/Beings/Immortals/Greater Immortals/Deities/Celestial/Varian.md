Varian was the brother of [[Thalorin]] and [[Elandra]]. 

He was the patron of the Anami people, having aided Anamos in founding them and fighting against Thadred. Varian was the king of Thalassos, and the mortal rulers were merely regents chosen by him. 

Some of his people went south, to Eldorath, and pledged themselves to Nebelum.

He had a circle of casters devoted to making sure the bindings of Asgorath held.

Varian was the first one to declare himself separate of the council and founded the Triad of Protectors.

He was a great enemy of [[Tharizdun]] and spoke against him often, and so when Tharizdun came to destory mortals he began with the Amani. 

Varian hunted for Tharizdun for a vast portion of the war, and confronted him, but [[Acheron]] had built Tharizdun's weapon, and Tharizdun thus killed Varian, though Tharizdun was left weakened.
