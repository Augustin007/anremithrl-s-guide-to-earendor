The Lady of Pain was an otherwise unnamed Elohim. She followed Thalorin and the Righteous Council during [[The Sundering War]].

She created the [[Labyrinth Stone]], and managed to trap [[Tartarus]] inside of it in a great battle. His last act was to lay on her a powerful curse to torture her to death.

She managed to prevent her death by shifting a section of the curse onto [[Ashdilkir]]. She eventually created a way to get rid of the pain end of the curse by making a deal with [[Marethyu]], losing the ability to communicate, but creating [[Sigil]], where she could feel no pain from the curse.

The curse also stripped her of most of her divinity and damaged her Sanity.

The nature of Sigil not only prevented the curse from reaching her, but it prevented any other divinity from entering, and so it did become known as a place to escape the gods.

Sigil became known as the City of Doors for some time, as she created many portals into other realms. But no one spoke to her or spent time with her, as the deal with Marethyu prevented her from trying to communicate in any way. Therefore she made the portals one way, and slowly trapped many people in Sigil in an attempt to combat her loneliness.

She discovered that killing someone as a method of communicating bypassed the deal, as the marethic energy was attracted to death and reduced the Torment of trying to communicate, and thus often Sigil her gaze alone is capable of inflicting grievous wounds and causing individuals to vanish without a trace. She does not care that it is harmful to others.[^1]

The Dabus carried out her will. Silent servants and extensions of her will, carefully built around the parameters of her the deal.[^1]

Marethyu released everyone from Sigil into the [[The Labyrinth of Insanity]] after a deal with [[Colossus Methunroa|Colossus]]. When she attempted to prevent this, Marethyu was capable of using the selfsame deal to kill the [[Lady of Pain]], freeing her of her loneliness[^1].
