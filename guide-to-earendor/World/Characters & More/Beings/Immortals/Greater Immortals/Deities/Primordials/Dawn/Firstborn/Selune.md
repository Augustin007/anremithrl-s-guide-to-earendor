Selune dwells in Elysium. 

Selune is one of the Firstborn, conceived from the primordial energies of [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]]. Her existence predates the formation of the Universe, and she the twin sister of Shar. While Shar embodies the darker aspects of existence, Selune represents the light.

She registers with strong positive Quiddity. She exists in the Almost and her region is permeated with Positive Quiddity. As the first source, Positive Quiddity holds some of her lingering intent.

During the Eternal Wars, Selune remained neutral and did not participate in the battles that raged across the planes but instead offered sanctuary to those who wished to abandon the conflict. Telos and Nehusta found refuge with Selune after fleeing from the Universe to escape the unending strife.

The [[Silanderi]] hold a bit of her Light.

[[Lysandra]] was one of her priestesses, and Selune allowed her to ascend to become a being of the same nature of a primordial, and is known as the goddess of Light.[^1][^2]
