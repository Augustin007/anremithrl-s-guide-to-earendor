Shar dwells in the Abyss. 

Shar is one of the Firstborn, conceived from the primordial energies of [[Isfet|Chaos]] and [[Ao|Order]]. Her existence predates the formation of the Universe, and she the twin sister of Selune.

She registers with strong negative Quiddity. She exists in the Almost and her region is permeated with her same quiddity. As the first source, Negative Quiddiity retains her lingering intent, which she goes out of her way to strengthen.

She fell in love with [[Tartarus]].

Shar whispered in [[Atropus]] and [[Dur-baagal]]'s minds and caused them to mar [[Asgorath]]'s creation and kick off the Eternal Wars. Shar did not participate, but they connived on how best to manipulate the others and so Tartarus did on occasion fight in the wars.

Shar was in the mind of [[Orcus]], whispering many things.

After [[The Sundering War]], she attempted to free [[Tartarus]], but was rebuffed by [[Asmodeus]]. All the same, her attempts left tendrils of her influence on the world. Including a creature meant to destroy the [[Trees of Sanctuary]], but turned into a protector by the [[Order of Names]].[^1][^2][^3]
