Arambar is the twin of [[Asgorath]]. 

Arambar and Asgorath created the planes of the universe, and offered each of their siblings true planes of their own and established the [[Ethereal Plane]] for themselves—a realm connected to all the other planes in the universe.

Arambar was a significant figure in the Eternal Wars, a cosmic conflict involving gods, Primordials, and other celestial entities. Initially outnumbered, he and Asgorath retreated to strategize. Arambar's patience and wisdom were invaluable during this period, as he considered the long-term implications of their actions.

When [[Atropus]] turned the Celestials on the other primordials, Arambar and Asgorath worked on a [[Epic Dragons|secret project]] to defeat the Atropus. When it was nearly complete, they were attacked. When it was defeated, Arambar chose to lead the Celestials on a final chase away from his brother. When he was finally brought down, in the moment of death he was offered a choice by [[Marethyu]], and he forgave the Celestials. His final act of defiance wrought an edict so powerful it granted every Elessar, Elohim, and Celestial, their own life and free will, freeing them from Atropus's dominion.
