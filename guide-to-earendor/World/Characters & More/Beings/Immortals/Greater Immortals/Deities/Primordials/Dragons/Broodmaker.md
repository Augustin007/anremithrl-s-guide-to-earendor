The Broodmaker was one of the four dragons made by [[Asgorath]] after the deaths of [[Arambar]] and the [[Eater of Dawn]].  The Broodmaker had the greatest malevolence and ambition, and lorded over the other three.

He convinced [[Asgorath]] to turn on his siblings and led the invasions. He took a particular liking to [[Istishia]], and took from her some of her strength. 

He swayed [[Asgorath]] away from ideals of peace.

He confronted the [[Silent One]] when he discovered the Silent One with several of the divine, and when the Silent One claimed them to be spoils for himself, the Broodmaker thought it a good idea and took some of his own. 

He took [[Rhea]] for himself, and forced her to bear [[Tiamat]] before killing her, but he bore no love to his daughter.

He killed the [[Silent One]] and [[Iris]] when he uncovered the truth of their love, and took [[Bahamut]] their child to himself, who he loved more than his daughter, and taught in the ways of cruelty.

The Broodmaker was eventually bested when he attempted to rescue a captive Bahamut. His remnants remain unfound.
