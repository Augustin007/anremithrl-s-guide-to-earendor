The Silent One was one of the four dragons made by [[Asgorath]] after the deaths of [[Arambar]] and the [[Eater of Dawn]].  He grew to be the gentlest and kindest, and grew to dislike Asgorath and the [[Broodmaker]] for their cruelty. He betrayed his kind and attempted to form a peace agreement, and when he couldn't, gave secret warnings to the Celestials. He did not delight in killing and attempted to save some of the peoples he conquered. When confronted by the Broodmaker he claimed they were slaves.

He fell in love with [[Iris]], and with her had [[Bahamut]]. The Broodmaker insisted he kill Iris after this, but he refused to harm her in any way, which led the Broodmaker to uncovering the truth and killing both of them, unmaking them and throwing them into pandemonium.
