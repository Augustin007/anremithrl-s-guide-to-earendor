Telos is a Primordial of Dusk. Before the Eternal Wars he fell in love with Nehusta and swore himself to her for eternity. He also was a friend of [[Kossuth]].

Nehusta and Telos loved to build and dwelled in pockets between the planes, populating them with beautiful creations. From them in this time came the Elessar, the eldest of the gods, born of their conjoined power and will and intent to build beauty. Powerful beings that loved building and wonder and assisted in the building of many wondrous things.

Forced into the conflict to protect their creations, Nehusta and Telos turned the Elessar away from building and into fighting. Many of the Elessar were slain or undone, and many of  their great creations were destroyed. Telos took up a blade of his creation, called the [[Sword of Eons]], and dived into the war to protect his love, fighting alongside his friend [[Kossuth]].

In the end, Telos took a great wound for Nehusta, and his essense was scattering across the universe, and Nehusta begged to the Dawn and led them in creating a new body for Telos. The two fled the Universe thereafter, and dwell in [[Elysium]] with [[Selune]], creating things.

His scattered remnants often bonded to things and scattered across the planes. Sometimes enough bits of his remnants come together and gain a modicum of sentience, which would became the Genasi.[^1][^2]

Telos is a methodical builder, crafting things of great utility but often lacking in aesthetic beauty. He only embarks on projects he believes he can complete, embodying the essence of persistence and focus. His methodical nature serves as the perfect counterbalance to Nehusta's spontaneity, and his meticulous plans provide the structure for her creative flair.
