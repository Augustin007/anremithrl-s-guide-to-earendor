Ubtao, of the Dusk, was known as the Heartseer. He was born in the heart of the universe, in its first essense, and his soulbond expanded across all of it. Thus he could see all that occurred everywhere and at once, including into the innermost thoughts of all beings, even [[Ao]] and [[Isfet]] themselves. Though as time passed the primordials learned how to avoid his notice if they so desired.

But it was overwhelming to him, and he tried to shut his mind away to it, and chose to dwell the the most still part of the universe, and was disturbed if anyone came to him. [[Akadi]] was the only Primordial who could visit Ubtao without disturbing him. And she loved him, and he perceived it and loved her back. 

Certain accounts claim that there is a descendent of the two of them. One of these accounts was found by [[Duren Vorasthar|Duren]], but gave no name or details.[^1] The [[Cobalt Archive]] tediously removes any reference to this. [[Methunroa]] suspected this to be hiding some great secret, but [[Theriad]] believed it was likely nothing.[^2]

When [[Atropus]] began carrying out his plan, he made sure to remain in overwhelming places when he thought of it, thus making sure that Ubtao would not focus his mind on Atropus. When Atropus and Dur-baagal did cause a disturbance, thus attracted Ubtao's attention. Atropus convinced him to say nothing in order to avoid conflict. When [[Asgorath]] and [[Arambar]] attempted to question Ubtao, he lied and said it must have been some strange accident, but had seen nothing. 

His betrayal was eventually discovered by the Dawn. In a final confrontation in the Root Hold, Ubtao was slain by Asgorath and [[Grumbar]], his essence scattered across the planes. This act caused a rift between Akadi and her brothers, as she was angered by his death.
