Lysandra was named after the Lys islands, on which she was born. 

She became a quasi-primordial.

Lysandra was a priestess of [[Selune]], the primordial of light. In a moment of desperation to save her people from a terrible plague, she offered her life to Selune. It is not understood why Lysandra ascended and no one else has ascended via Selune.

Selune transformed her into a quasi-primordial being, and Lysandra became the spirit of the Moon.

Lycanthropy began as a curse on one of her enemies.[^2]

The islands of Lys became known for Lysandra, to the point where the names were conflated. By the year 1600, the islands were firmly known as Lysandra.[^1]
