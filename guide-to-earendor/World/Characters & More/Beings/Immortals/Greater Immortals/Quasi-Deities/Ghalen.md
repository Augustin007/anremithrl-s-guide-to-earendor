Ghalen was a scholar obsessed with the mysteries of time. After decades of research, he discovered a way to step outside the normal flow of time, effectively becoming ageless. However, the ritual required a rare celestial alignment that occurred only once every thousand years, and the aid of [[Marethyu]]. Seizing the opportunity, Ghalen performed the ritual and vanished from the material plane. He now exists in a pocket dimension, where he continues his studies, occasionally stepping back into the world. The price he payed for Marethyu's help is unknown. 

He told [[Ashdilkir]] she would be the last thing to remain in the end of the world.

[[Tal'berius Tarrilion|Tal'berius]] somehow stole Ghalen's research out of beyond time and also made himself invisible to Ghalen.[^2]

[[William Treaty]] considered him when seeking allies during the events leading up to [[The Shattering]] but ultimately figured he was too unreliably reachable to devote time to.[^1]

Ghalen was at the Shattering and caused [[Kas]] to be moved through the Conduit and ascend into a Timeless, and prevents Ashdilkir from following, claiming Kas will return to her.[^1]
