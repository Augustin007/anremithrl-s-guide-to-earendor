"Nugget" Remshi was born to the Dragon King [[Valthor Remshi]] and [[Cae'ryn Tol]] thirty years before the end of the Dragonborn-Dwarven war. When he was six years old he and and his mother Cae'ryn were captured by the a Khazic special-forces. Military group as hostages against King Valthor. They tortured him and his mother in front of each other until her death. He was eventually rescued.

Nugget would be trained as a soldier and fight in the war in the subsequent years. The continuous fighting against them, combined with the losses of friends, propaganda, his experience being tortured, and the murder of his mother created an intense hatred for dwarves as a species and a refusal to see them as living beings or as anything other than monsters.

Nugget was firmly against the peace when peace talks began and was swiftly exiled by his father for refusing to follow it, along with a large contingent of men. For the next decade he roamed the north and struck at different dwarven settlements, but his numbers slowly dwindled, particularly under threats from his father, for few dared to cross the Dragon-king.

He was gravely injured when he and a group of fellow exiled soldiers attacked a dwarven camp, and his soldiers died around him. He escaped and was going to die in the snow, but survived by swearing service to Asmodeus in exchange for a promise of vengeance.[^1] 

Asmodeus led him meet and befriend [[Colossus]], because of Colossus's ties to the Raven Queen at the time. Nugget would spy on Colossus for Asmodeus, following him, and guiding Colossus to go northward, where they would take up a job under [[Id'ros Aka-Illion]] to attempt to discover the root of [[Auril]]'s power in the material plane.[^2] 

The friendship between Nugget and Colossus was tenuous and had much conflict.

Nugget resented how much Asmodeus controlled his life and felt Asmodeus was not aiding him in destroying the dwarves and lost faith in him, refusing to continue to follow Colossus after their falling out.[^3] When Asmodeus used the oath to start tearing him apart until he obeyed, the resentment of Asmodeus grew, and he became even less compliant.

Nugget bought a flying ship alongside [[William Treaty]] and the two plotted the foundation of the [[DragonArrow]] company.

Nugget drew from the deck of many things and disconnected his soul from his body.[^4] 

Nugget was drawn into the Nine Hells to be tortured for what he percieved as eight months, though it was only a few days on the material plane. 

They managed to bargain for his soul back, costing the life of [[a soul of greater or equal value]] and forcing a final favour out of both Nugget and Colossus. Nugget returned and swore a pact of vengeance on all who had wronged him, including dwarvenkind, Asmodeus, Auril.[^5]

He is chased by [[Acheron]]'s Hellhounds after [[Loquail]] trapped them in the Feywild, but made peace with them. He also in the Feywild reconciled with Colossus and began a much more genuine friendship with him.

Nugget is with the party when they meet [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] as they are returning to [[Westhaven]] to find it ruined. He likes Tal'berius and convinces the party to take the job that the arcanist offered.[^6] 

Nugget violently kills a dwarven apothecary he meets in Othron Ibrith and approves of [[Tal'berius Tarrilion|Tal'berius]]'s killing of [[Falledric]].[^7]

He tortures Nugget for eight months, eventually making a deal with his Colossus to return Nugget, still holding one last favor from Nugget he cannot refuse, and for one hour of Colossus’s time, to be collected at any point. Nugget returns, now driven mad by his months of torture, and swears an oath with his entire soul, to take revenge on everyone who wronged him. He includes Auril, Azmodeus, and the Dwarves with this oath.

Nugget kills a group of dwarves and attempts to incite a race war between the Goliaths and Dwarves of Bremen.[^8]. 

He was given the [[Labyrinth Stone]] by [[Ashdilkir]] and unintentionally absorbed the soul of the necromancer [[Voros Kaul]]. He used its power to make a bargain with [[Tartarus]], releasing Tartarus and sacrificing his sanity in exchange for the destruction of Asmodeus.

He arrived at the [[Trees of Sanctuary|Tree of Sanctuary]] alongside Sir William Treaty and Talberius, and found Lady Black already there along with her new companion Sock. [^9]

Colossus joined him shortly afterwards, but having discovered his evil deeds, refused to speak with him.[^9]

During the ensuing battle, Nugget was forced by Asmodeus's final favour to touch the tree, and thus was temporarily the conduit for the knowledge and the history of the universe. One thing he saw in this moment was that the dwarves were not at fault for the release of Auril, and that they also did not begin the Dragonborn-Dwarven war.[^9]

Asmodeus wished to take from him the name of [[The Forgotten One]]. He asked Lady Black and William Treaty to kill him to prevent Asmodeus's victory. He cursed himself so that his ghost could communicate as much information about Auril's release to Colossus, completing the mission they had been assigned by Id'ros.[^9]

His soul returned to the material plane when Asmodeus took the souls in Nessus with him, and he was placed in an Elduinari to act as a Soul Splice for [[Aeoife]]. [^10]

When the [[Analyst]] disarmed Aeofie, the DragonArrow company attempted to use the Elduinari to perform several resurrections. After a failed ressurection attempt, Nil'ge'tar was pushed into the dark regions to recreate Kas's ritual, and was resurrected as a vampire.[^11]

He was permanently killed in the Battle of Shadows.[^12]
