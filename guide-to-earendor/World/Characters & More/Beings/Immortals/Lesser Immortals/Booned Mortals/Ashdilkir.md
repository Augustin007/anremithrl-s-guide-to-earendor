Born eighteen years before the end of the Sundering War, to the Devaali people, she grew up knowing a land fraught with strife and destruction. She was raised to hate the gods, on all sides of this war, for causing the great cataclysms and desolations. Magic was seen as a bad thing, and children who exhibited any signs of magic or psionics were stoned. Ashdilkir showed signs of magic when she was little, but her parents forced her to hide it, beating her when she couldn't, hoping to save her life. She thus spent most of her time away from the village, in the woods.

When she was nine, a bright light shone in the woods. She followed it and she met the Lady of Pain in a crater, shortly after the Lady's battle with Tartarus, at the height of her Pain. Tartarus had cursed her as he was trapped, siphoning off all light and happiness from the Lady, forcing onto her pain and insanity, fragmenting her mind. If Tartarus's spell had finished taking hold it would have killed the goddess.

As the Ashdilkir came near, seeing the lady in pain, and not knowing better, offered to help. The goddess shifted part of the curse onto her, preventing her own death, and disappeared. The partial curse Connected her to the Lady of Pain, and so the girl bore a part of the suffering. 

Ashdilkir picked up a gem she found in the crater after the goddess left, and her father had it set into a necklace for her, and was going to give it to her when he eventually married her off.

When she was eleven, a group of raiders struck at her village, and she was captured. 

Her father began talking to the necklace, the only thing left of her, as he hoped for her return. The necklace, with Tartarus inside, spoke back, and whispered many things into his mind.

A few months into her captivity, her repressed magic spilled out in the form of an Obscurus, killing everyone around her. She returned to her people without an explanation, bearing marks of great suffering. She was not met with joy. Instead, many of them wanted to kill her, guessing she must have had magic for surviving. She felt as if she had done something of unmixed evil, by using magic to save herself, and the reaction of her people bolstered this belief, and so she hated herself for killing the raiders.

The next six years were spent this way. She built up a hatred of herself and of the gods and of magic. The affliction of her curse increased, and her pain grew worse. Her magic sometimes spilled out against her will. Her father was the only thing that prevented the villagers from killing her. She was hated and an outcast.

In the seventh year after her captivity, the Sundered war ended. Auril, ever cunning, was the last goddess to be locked away. In her final moments in the material plane, she unleashed Arganun, a final act of destruction, the great storm that split apart the earth and parted oceans, that nearly wiped out the peoples of Velmyria. 

Arganun passed over Ashdilkir's village, and Ashdilkir spent her life force and magic to save her people, and lingered on the brink of death.

In the gem, Tartarus was being driven insane by the chaos. He spoke to the father and offered a deal: Tartarus would grant one wish in exchange for the father's sanity. Tartarus saved the girl, and the father lost his mind, acting as little more than a timid wild animal, and refusing to eat, and died soon thereafter.

She had not wanted to live. She had hoped to die and be loved for her sacrifice. Instead, the people hated her and feared her. Her family was gone, and nobody stood between the village and their hatred. She tried to kill herself, again and again, to escape her village, and town, but the magic of Tartarus was too strong.

She fled. She spent the next century in a cave, coming out as little as she could, killing anyone who found her, hating the world and herself, feeling the eternal pain of hunger, starving without death, sleeping for weeks, months, with fevers and dreams, not knowing the war of the gods was over. At first she would leave every few days, then every few weeks, then months. By the end, she had not left in years. People avoided the region, for it was considered too dangerous.

It was [[Kas]] who found her. He had been searching for a dangerous place to hide one of the pieces of Vecna. The sort of place no one would dare approach. When she attempted to kill him he overpowered her easily. 

In the end, they spoke, and as neither had need to do the things of mortals, like eat or sleep, they spoke for a very long time. And she left her cave and traveled for a long while with Kas, and they had many adventures. For a long while they looked for a way to undo her curse of pain, to no avail. 

Throughout their travels, her mind deteriorated, she slowly became more and more unstable and insane. Her mind could not deal with the amount of memories she had to store, she forgot more and more. Sometimes forgetting years of her past at a time.

---

Eventually they parted ways, Kas wishing to continue to help her and Ashdilkir tired of getting her hopes up and forgetting things. As a final gift Kas told her the location of the Heart, and in the deep safety of the dungeon worked for her a spell to give her a grand library, filled with empty books, on which to write her memories, so that she would not forget.

She met Ghalen, the Chronomancer, who told her that she would be the last thing that remained at the end of Time.

She adventured on her own, travelling through other planes, where time flowed differently. She learned quickly that the curse affected her much less where time flowed quicker, its onslaughts less intense and more spread out.

At one point in these travels she met the Koluss, and he incurred some incalculable debt to her. It is unknown how she did this.

Thus it was that at one point she spent a hundred thousand years trapped in a demiplane of the Caverns of Stillness whilst only weeks past in the material plane, learning and practicing new things.

She took new identities, sometimes forgetting even her own immortality. She did good, and she did evil. Around her neck she wore the necklace, she spoke to Tartarus, but never gave him her sanity. And sometimes she thought he was her friend, bonded by hatred to the gods, but other times she hated him, and knew him to be evil. She never freed him, and she blamed him for what happened to her father. The two connived and planned for long against the gods.

She kept a diary, always, in memory of Kas, and trying to salvage her deteriorating memory. But things she wished to forget, evil things she had done, beautiful things she had lost, she would rip out, and it would fade fully from her memories, lessons unlearnt.

Marethyu offered to restore her mind once, but she refused his price. It is unknown what the price is, as only the refusal is recorded in her diaries. 

She often met with Kas, and she bore to him twins, [[Scathatch]] and [[Aeoife]]. When Kas eventually began ruling Bremen, near her library, he brought her many gifts, often to attempt to dispel her curse, to no avail. Among these was a shard of The Forgotten One's divinity, which she used to try to ascend, but was unable to complete the ascension without The Name.

They created the [[Den]], a sect of their followers who helped enforce their will and do things for them. The Den was often managed by the Koluss. The Den created a network of constantly active portals leveraging the Ley Lines for power, called their doors. 

Kas and Ashdilkir slowly grew apart as Ashdilkir's sanity slowly decayed. Kas kept his distance, seeking for a cure for his love.

In the end, she went mad in her own library. Eternally reading her own diaries. Trying to figure out who she was. Calling herself only "me". Blaming the gods. She continued to think about her decision to deny Marethyu's price, often coming back to that topic in her writings, but tearing out any mention of what the price itself was.

The [[Den]] was mostly destroyed by [[Tal'berius Tarrilion]] and [[Miyatol Dodonus]]. Kas rescued Ashdilkir from them, and she was shortly able to kill Miyatol. Remnants of it still exist.

5417 years after the Sundering, Asmodeus approached her. He offered to restore her memory in exchange for a favour: stealing the spell of Divine Unbinding given to Colossus by the Raven Queen. She agreed this, and regained her memory.

With perfected memory, she could remember everything she had chosen to forget, and it made her bitter and angry. She became burdened with her own evil and all the beauty and good torn away from her, and it sharpened her hatred of the gods.

> She knows Asmodeus cannot kill her, nor can anyone. She knows pain never ends. She is not afraid. She knows no goodness ever lasts forever (nothing does), so she has decided it doesn't matter. She cannot escape torture, pain, and suffering. She only wants to wreak vengeance upon the world for this, to inflict this pain onto everyone else too. Gods, who she hates for causing the pain, and mortals, who she hates for being able to escape it. Only the lesser immortals would she spare, for she has no anger with them. They are like her in one regard. Powerless against the gods, but unable to escape. But she holds little more than apathy for them. She cares only for herself. She wants the power to turn against the gods.

In service of her goals, she asked in secret something of Korvos, the Necromancer. She demanded he turn her into a quasi-deity, to bind to her the powers to destroy the gods. When he refused her (For in general he thought it unwise to make someone more powerful than he, and because he doubted his ability to do this safely, without great harm to himself, or he would have done it to himself long ago), in the same ploy as stealing the spell for Asmodeus, she orchestrated Korvus's death at the hands of Nil'ge'tar and Tal'berius and trapped his soul the Labyrinth-stone. 

Tartarus at this point slipped out of her grasp, Tartarus hoping for a new owner that might release him, who might aid his plans, and forced himself into the grasp of Nil'ge'tar Remshi. In this way, her plan was delayed, as Korvos, in the stone, was out of her reach.

She hated Asmodeus, but retained loyalty to him for a time for her own ends. 

She was greatly grieved when Scathatch died and tortured Xandred to death for killing her daughter.

Thorne attempted to kill her and she gained command over him.

In the year 5421, Tahlia Tormund was able to touch the Labyrinth stone when she came across William Treaty at the NAF alliance meeting. She was able to take the soul and traded it back to Ashdilkir in exchange for the location of the Oathbreaker Sword. Ashildir resurrected Korvos as a Lich, keeping his phylanctary. He bent to her will. Grateful, she traded captives, gold, and equipment to him for his experiments in return for her favour.

Right before the longest night, Korvos, combined with her vast library of knowledge and wealth, was able to complete her ascension into Ashariel. Korvos built in a weakness, a way to kill her, and secretly informed Kas of her plans. Kas was troubled.

During the shattering, Ashariel and Kas went to rescue their remaining daughter. Ashariel then attempted to take the power of the Ley Lines into herself, but Kas stopped her, attempting to use the weakness to try and kill her. Ghalen left the Almost and entered time to stop Kas, ejecting Kas from time and space. Ghalen prevented Ashariel from following Kas, assuring her of his return. They rescued Aeofie and left.

Ashariel laid siege to Arvandor the next day.
