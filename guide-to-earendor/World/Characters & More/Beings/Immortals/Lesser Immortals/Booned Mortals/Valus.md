The Eternal Warrior.

Valus was a child who came from Rymfel. He was the eldest child of eight. Hoping to help protect his family from the continuous crime, invasions, and deep-seated corruption, he spent his days learning combat. 

When a raiding party of Orcs struck, and he attempted to protect his siblings. He killed two Orcs during the raid before he was overpowered. 

He was saved by a mysterious figure who proceeded to fight off a force of Orcs on its own, using magic and skill.

After the battle, he tracked down the mysterious figure and asked it for training. The figure identified itself as [[Scathatch]], and agreed to help, as long as he used it to protect his family, because she admired his nobility.

He trained with Scathatch for some time, and soon became her star pupil.

Times became more peaceful, and Valus was able to go on longer and longer missions with Scathatch.

He heard Scathatch had not spoken with her sister [[Aeoife]], for quite some time, and helped Scathatch gain news. They tracked her down, but Aeoife refused to reconnect with Scathatch.

While Scathatch was away, One of Valus's sisters fell gravely ill. Valus shadowed groups of bandits and got captured along with various families, agreeing to save them only if they agreed to pay him, allowing them to die otherwise.

Scathatch caught wind of this and chastised him, and he grew angry and attacked her. She disarmed him and left him tied to a tree, telling him he would have to rely on the mercy of others, and she hoped they would show him more mercy than he had showed them.

During this time, there was a sacking of the town, which Valus saw from afar. Scathatch fought and was captured by an overwhelming force. Valus was unable to escape from his bounds in time, but he arrived to see the city destroyed and his family murdered. He swore revenge on Scathatch for tying him up, and on the enemy forces.

He tracked down the army and led a group of people against the army in guerrilla warfare. He found out Scathatch had escaped.

He tried to track her, but she eluded him. Eventually he realised he was no match for her, and besides, he wouldn't have been able to make a difference.

Thinking of Aeoife, he became a bounty hunter, using skills taught to him by Scathatch to take on demigods and other quasi-deities. 

Though mortal, he managed to obtain immortality by seeking out [[Marethyu]]. He has told no one of how he did this, only that he spent great amounts of money doing it.

He was contacted by Scathatch when Joanna's husband was dying, but he refused to help her.

He was similarly contacted by Aeoife when Niten was dying, but also refused to help her.
