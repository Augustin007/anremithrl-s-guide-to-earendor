Baeor was a half-Goliath half-dwarf from a family that traveled from [[Bremen]] to [[Neros]] before the [[Aetate Foedus]]. 

During his travels, he met [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] and the two became great friends after fighting [[Claron]].

He fought two constructs who attacked Richard when he was on his way to expose Tormac. These were actually constructs of [[Davros]].

He fought away the dragon Tormac when he returned.

He fought in the wars that established the Aetate Foedus, but was slain after being betrayed by the [[Selliso]] family, particularly Thorondor. He was great friends with [[Richard Iwaelfhem]].

He fought and killed the Aboleth of Rymfel.

He was temporarily resurrected by [[Sebastian De Clairmont]] to provide evidence against Thorondor, but his spirit dissapated after the trial, but [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] and Richard managed to save his escaping soul after Richard bound himself to [[Araushnee|The Raven Queen]] and bind it to a [[Telos Construct]].

He fought and killed Thorondor, avenging his own death.

He aided [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] and [[Galio Thunukalathi]] in the killing of the dragon [[Tormac]]
