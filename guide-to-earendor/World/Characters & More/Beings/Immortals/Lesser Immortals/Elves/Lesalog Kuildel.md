Lesalog Kuildel and Anremithrl Kuildel are twin brothers, not identical, both taller than even the average elf, who love each other deeply. They trained as soldiers under their mentor Aulien Mithron. When a war began with the Men of Rymfel between the High Elves of Avmorei, they have just been sent to their post, an important lookout tower and beacon named Dol Ibrith, the tower of the flame.

Lesalog STR: 13, CON: 13, DEX: 19, INT: 6, WIS: 6, CHAR: 19. He is dark golden-haired, slightly reddish, his armour is light, blued and gilded. His skin is not pale, like his brother’s. His cloak is a mottled green. He plays a Lute. He wears a bow on his back, and a quiver on his side. He is handsome and infinitely charming, but doesn’t know when to stop talking. He is very acrobatic and very hyperactive. He loves to tease his brother. When his brother reprimands him, he says he’s the younger one, (By a couple of seconds).
