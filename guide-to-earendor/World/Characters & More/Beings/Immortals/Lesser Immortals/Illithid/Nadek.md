Nadek was an illithid warlock who summoned beholders and other aberrations to challenge King Hrothgar Arden's rule of Swanward. He was the leader of the Beholders of Swanward, a group of powerful beholders that he had summoned from the depths of his lair in the Boleyn cave system. 
Nadek was known for his cunning and ruthlessness, as well as his ability to summon and command powerful aberrations. He was driven by a desire for power and control over others, and he viewed King Hrothgar Arden's rule as an obstacle that needed to be eliminated in order for him to achieve his goals.
Despite the challenges posed by King Hrothgar Arden's allies, Nadek managed to maintain a strong presence in Swanward and was able to continue to summon and command beholders. However, his ambitions ultimately led to his downfall, as he was eventually defeated by King Hrothgar Arden and the Beholders of Swanward were driven away from the land.
