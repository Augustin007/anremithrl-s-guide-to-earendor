[[Daedroy Belkar]] was a cleric of the [[Araushnee|Raven Queen]] and saved the [[Klaethor Vatiusen II]]'s life from poison. He helped [[Richard Iwaelfhem]] defeat [[Hechilspet]] after Hechilspet's near escape. Daedroy would go on to die to the [[Dracolich of Karr]].

Daedroy studied at Strixhaven alongside [[Miyatol Dodonus]], [[Stoic Vanem]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Narnor Azerim]]. He and Stoic both wanted to save lives, and they proceeded to study medicine. Daedroy also began in this time to pray to the Raven Queen, and he was chosen to be her next Champion. 

The pair reunited with Richard as he travelled to Oracus to warn the King of Treason. There they met [[Baeor Dechaius]].

He and Stoic were captured by the mysterious robes clad in green during one engagement with them.

After helping escort Richard, they returned to finish their studies. When Richard calls on them again, learning [[Tormac]] was trying to free [[Hechilspet]], Daedroy went, though Stoic did not. Here he met Lucy.

He aided Richard in subduing the nearly-escaped Hechilspet, calling upon the aid of [[Araushnee]].

When the [[Klaethor Vatiusen II|Klaethor]], Daedroy was the only one around, and he saved the king's life. He had to call on Stoic and was able to procure an expensive teleportation to get Stoic and his expertise in alchemy near. Richard was at this time recovering from his own wounds, and Daedroy was able to visit him.

When Tormac returned as a chromatic dragon, he fought him off along with [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Baeor Dechaius]]. He broke off his friendship with Stoic when Stoic chose to flee instead of fight.

He helped Richard rescue Miyatol.

He fought in the battle of the Aetate Foedus. Stoic and Baeor died there, and he guided them to the Shadowfell. When he guided their ghosts, he made amends with Stoic.

He died when he fought the Dracolich of Karr.
