#### **Physical Appearance**
Aric is fourteen years old. He is tall for his age, standing at 5'8". He's lean and wiry, with a body that hints at both recent growth and the onset of physical maturity. 
He has the build of someone who has had to work hard, with some definition in his muscles from manual labor or training.
Aric’s dark brown hair is cut short and often looks messy, reflecting his lack of concern for appearance in favor of practicality. 
His eyes are dark blue, with a serious, intense gaze that often seems older than his years. His eyes reflect the weight of the responsibilities he's had to take on too early in life.
Fair, but tanned slightly from time spent outdoors. His skin has a few small scars from scrapes, and blotches from dragon poison.
Aric wears simple, practical clothing—sturdy boots, a worn but well-maintained tunic, and trousers suitable for travel. He keeps a dwarven masterwork dagger given to him by Naras in it's sheath.

#### **Personality**
- **Protective:** Aric’s most defining trait is his protective nature, particularly toward his younger brother Lirien. This extends to the other children as well, whom he sees as his responsibility. He feels a strong need to keep them safe at all costs.
- **Loyal:** Aric is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. Once he considers someone part of his group, he will go to great lengths to protect them and ensure their safety.
- **Responsible:** Aric takes his responsibilities very seriously, sometimes to the point of burdening himself unnecessarily. He tries to do everything himself, from keeping watch at night to ensuring everyone has enough to eat, often neglecting his own needs in the process.
- **Traumatized:** The destruction of his city and the loss of his parents deeply traumatized Aric, but he has buried these feelings to focus on survival. He hasn’t had time to process his grief fully, and it lingers in the back of his mind, occasionally surfacing in moments of quiet.
- **Vulnerable:** While Aric is determined to keep everyone safe, he is still a young boy dealing with an unimaginable situation. There are moments when the facade of strength cracks, revealing his vulnerability and fear. However, he quickly pushes these feelings aside, unwilling to let them interfere with his duties.
- **Lonely:** Despite being surrounded by others, Aric feels a deep sense of loneliness. He shoulders the burden of leadership and protection largely on his own, and he doesn’t want to worry the others by sharing his doubts and fears. This isolation can weigh heavily on him, though he hides it well.
- **Natural Leader:** Aric naturally takes on a leadership role, often being the one to make decisions for the group. He is careful and methodical, always thinking ahead about the group’s safety and next steps. He rarely hesitates to take charge in a crisis.

#### **Backstory**
Aric was born in the city of Bremen where he lived with his younger brother, Lirien, and their parents. His family was of modest means, but they were close-knit. Aric’s father was a carpenter, and the family together ran a small apothecary. His parents instilled in him a sense of responsibility for others.

When the dragon attacked and the city was destroyed, Aric witnessed the deaths of everyone he knew. He watched his parents fall to the dragon poison right in front of him. He was saved by Naras, Talor, and Torquil.

Since the destruction of their home, Aric has become the de facto leader and protector of among the five rescued children, burdened by the weight of ensuring their survival in a world that suddenly became terrifying and dangerous.

- **Naras**

  - Aric feels pressure to live up to Naras’s example, pushing himself to take on more than he can handle. He is eager to prove his worth to Naras, seeking validation from him.

- **Kerran**
  - Aric feels a paternal instinct toward Kerran.

- **Talor**
  - Aric appreciates the bugbear’s strength and reliability. Talor’s presence makes Aric feel more secure, especially when the group is in dangerous situations. 
  
- **Torquil**
  - Aric can't really figure out Torquil. While Torquil seems nice, he can tell Naras doesn't like him much, and his gut tells him something is wrong with Torquil, but he did see Torquil save Kerran's life. Aric is a bit awkward and not very talkative with him.
