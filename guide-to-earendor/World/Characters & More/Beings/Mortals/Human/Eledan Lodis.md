Eledan Lodis was a follower of Sorian. At one point he mantained trade between Cyddartiame and the Echorias valley, and led the Clansmoot. 

During this time, he became a good friend of [[Thalen Nokkaran]]

He eventually ascended to become Sorian's second in command, and left Echorias valley soon thereafter. 

After Sorian's death, there were some people calling the Archivist's Eledan's Order, in an attempt to make a more memorable name, and one that would be more recognisable through the ages, he rebranded the archivists as the Cobalt Order.

He would go on to sicken and die in his later years.
