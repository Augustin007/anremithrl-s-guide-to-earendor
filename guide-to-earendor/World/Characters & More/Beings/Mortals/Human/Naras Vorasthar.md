Tas-Naras Vorasthar was born on the 30th of Lliira, 5395 AS, to King Tar-Duren XVIII and Queen Tar-Heas of House Vorasthar. He was the youngest child, born after his sister Iselda and brother Valsaris. Three years later his nephew Nokkaran was born to Iselda and her husband, the high general Eldan Torvik. Naras and Nokkaran grew together as playmates and friends, despite Nokkaran’s harsher parentage. The boy who would later be called Stormblessed grew up in the shadow of siblings locked in bitter rivalry—Iselda ambitious and cruel, Valsaris eloquent and kind.

In 5403 AS, after the sudden illness and death of their parents, Valsaris fled Kesna. Iselda seized the throne as Queen Iselda III, spreading whispers that her brothers had poisoned their parents and abandoned the realm. Naras, still a boy, fled with Valsaris to Cydaritarmel, where the Cobalt Order gave them shelter. The Archivists inducted Naras as an acolyte, while Valsaris, too old to be accepted, renounced his claim for a time and remained as guest.

The Cobalt Archive became Naras’s home. There he learned history, astronomy, survival, and the arcane secrets the Archivists hoarded. He befriended Akor, another student, and deepened his bond with his brother, who returned often with news from Kesna. In 5406 AS, after the assassination of the High-Aegis Sandak by Iselda’s Silver Hand, the Grand Magistier Kalas encouraged Valsaris to reclaim his birthright. Naras, though tempted by the call of artifacts, was guided by Valsaris toward politics, leadership, and honor.

In 5408 Naras survived a night alone in a chaos storm. From then he was called Stormblessed. That same year he entered training with the Aegis of the Cobalt Order and bonded with Syl, an incorporeal genasi spren from the Shadowfell. With her companionship he was never without light, nor without laughter. Two years later, he earned his stripes and served the Aegis for four more years, a spearman and warrior of the Order. Meanwhile Valsaris was granted the southern lordship of Nirhak, far from the capital, as Iselda sought to exile his influence.

Naras joined his brother in Nirhak in 5412 AS, serving both the Cobalt Order and his house. Together they plotted rebellion in secret, joined even by Nokkaran, though his proximity to his mother made him unreliable. They gained support among the Vorokai lords, but their plans were interrupted in 5413 AS when the Cherhal invaded the southern coasts. At Iselda’s summons they fought for their people under her banner, knowing she had laid the trap. They retreated slowly, disease and plague weakening their men. At last they made their stand at Kerhal, holding the fortress-chasm with only seven hundred men for two years.

In 5416 AS reinforcements arrived at last—fifty thousand strong. Naras and Valsaris planned a night attack, certain of victory. Yet at the crucial moment, Iselda’s loyalists abandoned them. The Cherhal fell upon them, and the brothers were betrayed. In the fighting Valsaris was struck down with an arrow through the eye. Naras fought to die beside him, but was captured alive.

Three years of captivity followed. No ransom came. Naras passed through eight masters, branded with the shash. He endured fighting pits and servitude, surviving only through defiance, dignity, and the presence of Syl. By 5419 AS he was little more than a broken slave, sold cheap to the necromancer of Azerim for experiments. There he met Thalai Elanthino, a goliath soldier. Together they attempted escape; Thalai was slain by golems, but Naras staggered free into the storm.

In 5421 AS Naras was found by Talor, a hermit of the Darkwood, who gave him shelter. In Talor’s hut the fellowship of the Path of Honor was forged, joined also by Ahktos Nestore, a gnome trickster. Naras, scarred but unbroken, carried with him the legacy of the Vorokai: betrayed prince, archivist-trained warrior, slave branded but undefeated, and the Stormblessed. From that hut began the long path that would bind his fate to gods and mortals, in rebellion, vengeance, and the search for honor.

Naras was a prince and son of King Duren XVIII. He followed his older brother out of the Kesnan Kingdom when their elder sister Iselda turned against them.

The two were taken by the Cobalt Order in the kingdom of Cyddartiame. He was trained and inducted into the Cobalt Order. His brother made sure to keep up both of their martial training and to learn politics. 

Naras became friends with Akor, a fellow Cobalt Acolyte, the two were inseperable for much of their youth. He trains with spell spheres, but has no raw talent for casting. He forms a bond with a Spren, or a Spirit Genasi, from the Shadowfell, name Syl, in order to wield the Spell Spheres.

Valsaris continued to hear of the Kesnan Kingdom. Iselda had become queen after their father died. Valsaris suspected her of poisoning their father and left the Cobalts, and Naras followed. Queen Iselda was unpopular and a tyrrant. Valsaris knew the law well, and besides was good with his words and well-liked. Under pressure from Valsaris, she granted him lordship of Nirhak, far from the capital, towards the South.

Naras served under his older brother. Valsaris grew in popularity. The generosity of the brothers became well known, and they garnered support among the Vorokai, hosting meetings and talking of treason.

It was during this time that the war with Cherhal began, and Queen Iselda saw it as her saving grace. She knew that the lords were loyal to the people, and would fight in the defense of the kingdom before they would fight with her. With the aid of her husband, she had a contingent of soldiers loyal to the crowd suddenly abandon the two brothers mid-battle, leaving them to die. The brothers fought valiantly, side by side, and they wrecked great destruction.

Then a quarrel struck Valsaris in the eye, and he was no more.

Naras faltered, and in that moment he was captured, and he begged to be killed but they ignored the prince.

He was questioned for information multiple times, but Naras did not speak, and he was imprisoned and forgotten about. After the war was over he was sold with the rest of the prisoners of the war into slavery. 

He served eight masters, though to the kinder ones he was far more dignified, cordial, and useful than other slaves, to the crueler ones he was difficult and dangerous. For this, he was given a *Shash* brand, marking him as dangerous, and when his last owner had had enough of him, he was sold at a deep discount to the necromancer of Azerim for experimentation.

| From the Journal of the Stormblessed Prince. | Of my earliest youth in Kesna I remember little. Iselda is and was then of the crueller nature that affects many of the Vorokai caste, and Valsaris, younger than she, was of a more kind spirit. They played the game of politics—befriending generals and nobles—and they were ever at odds. Whatever feud stood between them I never knew, save that my brother thought my sister selfish and ambitious. I was too young and frivolous to pay any attention.  <br>Nokkaran was 3 years my younger, he was the son of my sister. He was closer in age to me than Valsaris, and thus we two played often. Nokkaran craved to prove his worth in battle, misguidedly trying to follow in his fathers footsteps. Nokkaran dreamed of leading his army to riches and glory.  <br>We were good friends. What mix of genetics spawned my friend I do not know, for he was neither cruel nor harsh as his parents were. He was not heartless like my sister, and he was not ruthless like his father, Eldan Torvik, who had raised the hosts of the Vorokai and forced them by sheer will and calculated coldness into becoming an even more dangerous tool for the kingdom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| From the Journal of the Stormblessed Prince. | I have since heard that it was announced that my brother had gone to Cyddartiame to reinforce the alliance.  <br>It was not far from the truth. We did reach Cyddartiame, though the journey was grueling. By the time we reached it was known that our father was dead, and our sister was now Queen Iselda III.  <br>My brother spoke to the archivists, and they came and told me they wished to induct me into the Cobalt Order.  <br>Upon reaching Cyddartiame, my brother spoke with the archivists in their high council. When he returned he explained to me that the archivists had agreed to induct me as an acolyte of their order. He was too old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| From the Journal of the Stormblessed Prince. | The Cobalt Archive is the home that I remember, for there it was that I grew in reason. I was taught of the arcane and the ancient, of history and archeology, survival and astronomy, of all those things the archivists require. I remember my friends there, foremost among them Akor.  <br>My brother was often there, though he’d leave for months at a time. He brought me news of Kesna and of friends I hardly remembered. But in this way it was that I maintained some correspondence with Nokkaran.  <br>Had it not been for my brother, I think I would have lived the life of an archivist. Living solely for the artefacts of the ages past, willing to lie and kill and sacrifice every bit of self and honour just to study them. But my brother saved me from such immorality. He taught me politics and leadership and instilled in me the traditions of the Vorokai.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| From the Journal of the Stormblessed Prince. | Under Valsaris’s leadership, we garnered support among the Vorokai, hosting meetings and speaking of treason in hushed tones. We were hesitant, for she was our sister, and we harboured some love for her, otherwise, perhaps, we could have ended her rule then and there. Nokkaran, my sister’s own son, and my good friend, stood with us against his mother, but we could not trust him with much, as he was too close to her and her spies.  <br>Now, Iselda was not oblivious to the machinations of my brother, and she grew worried, for her influence by fear was matched by ours of allied rebellion, and we heard news that Fodik, the son of Mirhas, a confident of ours, was found dead, and we suspected the Rassac had been sent by my sister.  <br>Perhaps had the timing been otherwise, we could have responded, but this assassination coincided with the beginning of the war with Cherhal.  <br>At the southernmost tip, Nirhak was the first of the provinces to feel the enemy. It provided my sister with the perfect opportunity. She knew that the lords were loyal to the people, and would fight in the defence of the kingdom before they would fight with her.

Journal of Naras

  

Entry 1:

Sarand, 14th of Vorsar, Modern Year 5423. (Naras here uses the Modern Year, a different, older, calendar than the more accurate Sundering Year, Naras is habituated to it because of Kesnan tradition. The Sundering Yearwould mark this same date as 22nd Nightal, 5421 After the Sundering)

I, Prince Naras Vorasthar, called Stormblessed, son of the late King Duren XVIII, write this journal both for myself, to clear my thoughts after such long imprisonment, and for posterity, should anything befall me before my return to Kesna.

It is good to be able to write again. As I write this, my dear friend Syl provides the light. She has been my constant companion and I owe her much gratitude. Talor snores, and the little man is still half-frozen and by the fire.

What runs through my mind now is thus:

Of my earliest youth in Kesna I remember little. Iselda is and was then of the crueller nature that affects many of the Vorokai caste, and Valsaris, younger than she, was of a more kind spirit. They played the game of politics—befriending generals and nobles—and they were ever at odds. Whatever feud stood between them I never knew, save that my brother thought my sister selfish and ambitious. I was too young and frivolous to pay any attention.

Nokkaran was 3 years my younger, he was the son of my sister. He was closer in age to me than Valsaris, and thus we two played often. Nokkaran craved to prove his worth in battle, misguidedly trying to follow in his fathers footsteps. Nokkaran dreamed of leading his army to riches and glory.

We were good friends. What mix of genetics spawned my friend I do not know, for he was neither cruel nor harsh as his parents were. He was not heartless like my sister, and he was not ruthless like his father, Eldan Torvik, who had raised the hosts of the Vorokai and forced them by sheer will and calculated coldness into becoming an even more dangerous tool for the kingdom.

My frivolity began to end when I turned my eighth year. That year I was gifted Nevakas, the most regal and beautiful axehound that there ever was, and my first spear, that I may begin to train with it. I was to follow the path outlined by the Vorokai who came before me.

It was not long after that when it occurred. I know with no detail what it was. I suspect my brother uncovered something of Iselda’s plans and ambitions that forced his hand, but the two no longer spoke as friends. And two nights later, Valsaris came to my room in secret and in haste, saying he had made preparations and would have to flee. He had come to say goodbye.

“Where are you going?”

“Away.”

“Why, Valsaris?”

“I know our sister. She plays for power without restraint. I’ve warned father, but he is deaf to all but her honeyed words. Time grows short.”

“You haven’t answered. Why are you leaving?”

“I can’t win this game, Naras. She’s willing to go to lengths I cannot. She has the court in her grasp, has fought her way to the top with lies, deceit, and betrayal. She has her husband, the general, and the support of our father. When she betrays him too, there will be no one left to oppose her. I cannot stay here, waiting like a lamb for slaughter.”

I did not understand much of what my brother said that night, but I begged to go with him, and so he took me, leaving a note by a trusted servant to our father. I have since heard that it was announced that my brother had gone to Cyddartiame to reinforce the alliance.

It was not far from the truth. We did reach Cyddartiame, though the journey was gruelling. By the time we reached it was known that our father was dead, and our sister was now Queen Iselda III.

Upon reaching Cyddartiame, my brother spoke with the archivists in their high council. When he returned he explained to me that the archivists had agreed to induct me as an acolyte of their order. He was too old.

The Cobalt Archive is the home that I remember, for there it was that I grew in reason. I was taught of the arcane and the ancient, of history and archeology, survival and astronomy, of all those things the archivists require. I remember my friends there, foremost among them Akor.

My brother was often there, though he’d leave for months at a time. He brought me news of Kesna and of friends I hardly remembered. But in this way it was that I maintained some correspondence with Nokkaran. 

Had it not been for my brother, I think I would have lived the life of an archivist. Living solely for the artefacts of the ages past, willing to lie and kill and sacrifice every bit of self and honour just to study them. But my brother saved me from such immorality. He taught me politics and leadership and instilled in me the traditions of the Vorokai.

At his urging, too, I joined the Aegis of the Cobalt Order, and I trained first with mundane weapons, for I had no talent for casting and attunement. It was the spear I took to the most. 

Spell Spheres are common in the order, and indeed the secret of their making lies with us. Now, among the Aegis, it is tradition that fighters do not stand alone. There is an alliance between the Cobalt Order and the incorporeal genasi, spren from the shadowfell. By a ritual known only to us, able to be replicated even by those with little talent for magic, we can form bonds with these spren, and thus the spren can use the spell spheres that we hold for them, and thus we pair up, from a young age. I befriended and bonded with a spren named Syl, and she never left my side.

Syl is my dear friend, and though she is older than the Sundering itself it does not reflect in her demeanour. Her nature is to be playful and kind. She shares in my hatred of lies and deception.

It was six years after my arrival in Cyddartiame that I was granted my stripes, and I served the Aegis for four years beyond that. During those four years my brother stayed in Cyddartiame less and less, preoccupied with my sister’s tyranny in Kesna.

Queen Iselda was unpopular and a tyrant. Valsaris knew the law well, and besides was good with his words and well-liked. Under pressure from Valsaris, she granted him lordship of Nirhak, far from the capital, towards the South.

Ten years after my departure from Kesna, I was given leave to return with my brother. The archivists wished to establish a trade in Kesna, and Valsaris had given them leave in his jurisdiction of Nirhak, with me there were ten others. 

Now, Valsaris was much more well-liked than my tyrant of a sister, and together we garnered much support. 

Under Valsaris’s leadership, we garnered support among the Vorokai, hosting meetings and speaking of treason in hushed tones. We were hesitant, for she was our sister, and we harboured some love for her, otherwise, perhaps, we could have ended her rule then and there. Nokkaran, my sister’s own son, and my good friend, stood with us against his mother, but we could not trust him with much, as he was too close to her and her spies.

Now, Iselda was not oblivious to the machinations of my brother, and she grew worried, for her influence by fear was matched by ours of allied rebellion, and we heard news that Fodik, the son of Mirhas, a confident of ours, was found dead, and we suspected the Rassac had been sent by my sister. 

Perhaps had the timing been otherwise, we could have responded, but this assassination coincided with the beginning of the war with Cherhal.

At the southernmost tip, Nirhak was the first of the provinces to feel the enemy. It provided my sister with the perfect opportunity. She knew that the lords were loyal to the people, and would fight in the defence of the kingdom before they would fight with her. She called us and our allies to defend the kingdom, knowing that we would fight for our people even if it meant serving under her banner. We fought valiantly, side by side, as we had always done. 

We were strung out. Slowly but surely, we were forced to give ground.

The plan was Karathal. Most of Nirhak was lost, but there is a great chasm that delineated the northern border of Nirhak, and the only way through was through a fortress in Karathal. It was a chokepoint. A bottleneck. We held out there for three months, less than 700 of us, waiting for support from further in Kesna, and none came. 

Then, at last, a force of fifty-thousand arrived. And we rejoiced, for much of the Cherhic forces were there, and we had every advantage. This victory would be a great blow to them. With our renewed force we launched an attack in the middle of the night.

But betrayal was in the air, and Iselda’s loyalists abandoned us at the crucial moment, and then it was us who were outnumbered, exposed, and surprised. 

We fought valiantly, aiming to return to the fortress and hold it, but we were routed, and we cost the Cherhal, for every man of Kesna took two of the enemy.

We attempted then to retreat, to regroup in the caves, but they hunted us. Shallan, a girl I had known from Cherhal, who had trained in the Aegis with me, escaped through these caves, and with her a group of around twenty men. My brother and I, and those who were with us, were not so lucky, for our hiding spot was discovered. Fifty men fought and fell valiantly alongside my brother, but in the end it was just the two of us, side by side, as ever.

A quarrel struck Valsaris in the eye, and he was no more.

Enraged, I left my cover, hoping to die as my brother did, but I had no such luck. Though I begged them to kill me, and though it cost men, they hoped to gain information from me, and so I was taken alive.

I was tortured for information, but I held my tongue. None of their threats of death or pain mattered to me. When the war ended, I was sold into slavery along with many of the other surviving prisoners.

I served eight masters across three years, though to the kinder ones I was far more dignified, cordial, and useful than other slaves, to the cruller ones I was difficult and dangerous. For this, I was given a shash brand.

 In the end I was sold at a deep discount to the necromancer of Azerim for experimentation. During all this time, my sanity slowly frayed. It was during this darkest time that Syl, ever my companion, kept me from falling into complete despair. The bond we shared was my only comfort in those long, bleak years.

I was lucky. The Necromancer left soon after purchasing me and did not return. My cellmate, a Goliath from Solenthir, with whom I was unable to exchange any words, helped me break out of my cell. We did not both manage to escape, and he fell to golems that guarded the gate. 

It was then that I met Talor. One of the bugbears, from his fur I assume he is from the Darkwood, though we are in Golin. He has taken me, and a small man-like being we found frozen in the snow on the way back, into his home. Talor has been very hospitable, and I hope to return the kindness.
