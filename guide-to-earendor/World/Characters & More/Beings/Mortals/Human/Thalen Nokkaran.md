Thalen was a member of the Rassac tribe, and a master assasin, forager, and negotiator. He went on to become fast friends with Duren Vorasthar and help him unify the tribes, convincing the Rassac tribe to ally with the Vorasthar. He was a great friend of the archivists and introduced Duren to [[Eledan Lodis]].

He died fighting a chasmfiend, defending his friend Duren.
