Vorlin was born in the upper middle-class of Trixail. His father Lon Talvas, was the captain of a trading ship for Remshi Co.

He was very close to his mother, Maira.

When he was nine years old, a violent storm swept through Trixail. The city flooded, and lightning struck him directly. When he awoke, he told the storm to go away, and it did.

He took after his father and learned to sail. He honed his magic of the weather and became a ship-mage. In the trade, he quickly developed a drinking and gambling addiction. He picked fights with his crewmates, and was feared and regarded as a bully.

Eventually he was fired from the ship, and he ended up alone in a strange city. Accumulating debts whilst gambling and trying to live a life of luxury, he began to steal. This, and his command over the weather, attracted the local gangsters, who began hiring him on various jobs. They soon realised he had no reservations, if they put a knife in his hand and bade him to kill, he would.

He pursued this life of crime with vigor. He fought in border skirmishes, signed onto raiding bands, and learned that the only thing more important than power was money.

He had no grand cause, no moral compass. He followed whoever paid the most.

He fought in the Bloodbath of Kanra in 5411 AS, where he witnessed his employer massacre an entire village after securing their surrender. He felt nothing.

By 5413 AS, he had become notorious among mercenary companies—too unpredictable, too ruthless. He gambled, drank, and racked up debts to dangerous people.

The Red Scars, a mercenary band he had once worked for, put a price on his head after he abandoned them in a contract gone wrong.

At twenty-six, he was out of money, allies, and time.

The Sol’karis were not his first choice.

In 5414 AS, a wandering Sol’karis scholar, Navos Lodron, saved Vorlin’s life after a botched job. Vorlin had no illusions about Lodron.

he was one of those idealistic fools who thought people could be saved.

But the Sol’karis were untaxed, exempt from prosecution, and well-connected. Joining them shielded him from his enemies.

He played the role of the repentant warrior, pretending like he cared about their cause. He joined the order to lay low and stay alive.

He resented their philosophy, their self-righteousness, their talk of wisdom and duty. He took every opportunity to steal from their supply caches, selling goods in secret to slowly pay off his debts.

He made loose allies in the order, but never friends.

When Xalvor began his investigations about the cult, Vorlin was told to look over the reports. As he did this, he noticed the cult seemed to have artifacts and funds. Things he could steal to pay off his debts.

Vorlin saw an out.

He volunteered in a heartbeat.
