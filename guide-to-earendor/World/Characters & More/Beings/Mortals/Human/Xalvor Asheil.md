Xalvor never knew his parents. He was found as a newborn, wrapped in a tattered cloak, abandoned at the gates of a Sol’karis hall.

Showing aptitude for magic even as a child, he was taken in by the Sol'karis. Raised among scholars, wanderers, and mages, he grew up surrounded by books, philosophy, and magic.

He was eventually taken in by Edrin Vel, a wanderer and diviner and one of the older members of the Sol’karis. Edrin taught Xalvor his love of the stars.

As he grew older, he formed a close friendship with Miris Haleth, a bright and outspoken young enchantress. Miris challenged his reserved nature, pulling him into the world of people rather than just ideas. She was reckless where he was careful, spontaneous where he was methodical. But the two were inseparable, and together, they dreamed of uncovering the deepest secrets of magic.

By the time he was fifteen, Xalvor had already mastered several advanced divination spells, earning a reputation within the Sol’karis halls. He began traveling more frequently, participating in archaeological digs, deciphering ancient texts, and consulting with scholars across the empire.

At around this point he met Dren, and the two were loose acquaintances.

In 5417 AS, he (and indeed, all diviners) began to see a darkness in their visions, an obscuration of what was to come. It became difficult and unpredictable to attempt to divine possible futures. 

His mentor Edrin died that same year.

Xalvor tried very hard to see further into the future, to figure out the cause of this darkness. He saw glimpses of forgotten gods stirring, of fire and ice clashing, of people calling his name in moments of despair.

Here he met Kaelith, who encouraged his obsession.

Miris Haleth, now a respected enchanter in the Sol’karis, worried for him, and convinced him to drop his obsession, taking a distrust of Kaeleth.

In 5419 AS, Miris vanished after some bandits attacked her to steal an artifact she was studying. Investigations led by Xalvor led to the uncovering of a cult aiming to free Hechilspet.

Hoping to discover what occurred to Miris, and rescue her if possible, he was the first to volunteer for the mission.
