When [[Maraveth Kalagiano]] died, her family convinced young Iti'esse to seduce King Valthor. She was shortly with child, and Valthor felt compelled to marry her to avoid scandal. She mothered [[Ma'vro'ric'kath Remshi'il]], and [[Ka'vral'tar Remshi'il]], but was poisoned by political rivals. During this time, Valthor also fathered a bastard daughter, who Iti'esse raised [[Mael'thene'vel'dral Dan'il]].
