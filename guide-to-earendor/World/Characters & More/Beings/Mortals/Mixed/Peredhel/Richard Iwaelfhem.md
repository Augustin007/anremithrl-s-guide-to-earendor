Richard, the head of the Ordus Texerum, is a wise and experienced half-elf who has dedicated his life to protecting Neros from magical threats. He is known throughout the country as a powerful wizard and a fierce defender of the realm.

After completing his schooling alongside [[Stoic Vanem]], [[Narnor Azerim]], [[Daedroy Belkar]], and [[Miyatol Dodonus]], he took a temporary post in the town of [[Aleras]] as a lesser member of the Ordus Texerum, where he fought away the Dire-Wolves. 

He was especially close to Narnor, and mantained a correspondence with her.

He met Lucy in the woods after investigating the source of the Abberations, and together they fought and killed [[Fildor]] a cleric of [[Shar]].

Uncovering a plot after inspecting Fildor's base, he began traveling north, reuniting with [[Stoic Vanem]] and [[Daedroy Belkar]] and meeting [[Baeor Dechaius]]. 

He was chased by rogues clad in green robes, which he originally thought may have been rangers from Swanward.

He fought and killed the lesser beast-dragon [[Claron]] alongside [[Baeor Dechaius]] while Stoic and Daedroy were captured by the mysterious rogues.

He rescued Miyatol from Lucy and Tormac. Lucy spares his life, repaying her dept from the battle with Fildor. 

He exposed [[Tormac]] and the order of spies Tormac belonged to, known as the [[The Greenclad]] to [[King Klaethor|Prince Klaethor]]. The spies were from the region of (old) [[Rymfel|Karr]].

He was greatly saddened when he heard of Narnor's death.

When Richard exposes Tormac, Lucy finds out Tormac killed [[Narnor Azerim]], and as she had promised to avenge her, she is conflicted. Her hesitation causes Tormac to attempt to kill her, and Richard saves her life and forgives her.

Exposing Tormac spurred spurred the war of wrath.

He fought off [[Tormac]], the previous head of the order, when Tormac allied himself with [[Tiamat]] and tried to free [[Hechilspet]] from his [[Hechilspet's Prison|Prison]], and subdued Hechilspet.

He was a good friend of [[King Klaethor]] when he ascended to the throne.

He travelled a bit on his own and met [[Katniss]] when he fought [[Nordoth]], the young black chromatic dragon. Here he gained the [[Oathbow]].

He and [[Miyatol Dodonus]] were interrogating a prisoner and thus were present during the great escape from [[Dol Garoth Prison]]. Richard was unable to save Miyatol from being taken hostage.

When Tormac returned as a chromatic dragon, he and his companions, [[Baeor Dechaius]], [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], and [[Daedroy Belkar]] fought him off until he retreated to Rymfel.

Richard went with Daedroy after this to rescue Miyatol.

He fought in the battle of the Aetate Foedus, where his friends [[Stoic Vanem]] and [[Baeor Dechaius]] were slain.

He fought the [[Dracolich of Karr]] alongside Daedroy, [[Miyatol Dodonus]], [[Tyko]], and Lucy, but Daedroy and Tyko died, and the Richard and Miyatol were forced to flee, leaving Lucy behind to be captured. His oathbow was left behind, and Bechel obtained it.

They rescued Lucy from [[Bechel of Bharam]] a year later, getting the help of [[Marethyu]].

He married Lucy after this.

He was elected head of the Ordus Texerum.

He fought away the [[Beholders of Swanward]] with Lucy and Miyatol.

He was quite troubled when he heard of Miyatol's mysterious death in Bremen.

He would become a good friend of [[Theriad Keladri]], and manage to get Keladri a spot on the Geraseum.

He helped [[Helena Naema]], [[Sebastian De Clairmont]], and [[Zahel-ben-minos]] expose the [[Selliso]] and [[Claremonts]].

When Sebastian did a difficult temporary ressurection spell and recovered the soul of [[Baeor Dechaius]], Richard dived into the [[The Labyrinth of Insanity]] with [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]] and became a warlock of the Raven Queen to resurrect his friend.

Richard would die of old age at 885 years old.
