The Attendants of Knowledge are clerics who serve Nebelum and his Grand Library of Lorekeep. They are integral to the maintenance of the library, possessing a profound understanding of its contents and guiding seekers in their quest for knowledge. The Attendants of Knowledge gather all the information they can, guided by their god [[Nebelum]], and bring it to the library, and have done so for nearly ten thousand years.
The Lorekeep, with its boundless collection and the enlightenment it offers, is a beacon of knowledge and learning in the fabric of Eärendor.
The Attendants of Knowledge are not only keepers of the vast collections but also protectors of the Lorekeep itself. They strive to maintain the safety and sanctity of the library from any form of harm or disruption that may arise due to its immense power and influence. 
The Attendants of Knowledge work tirelessly in their quest for knowledge, ensuring that Eärendor remains a bastion of learning and enlightenment.
