The Beholders of Swanward were a group of beholders summoned by the Illithid warlock of [[Shar]], [[Nadek]], when [[King Hrothgar Arden]] named himself the first king of Swanward after he united the tribes of the area, and began to drive away the aberrations that plagued the land. 
The Hive of beholders was based in the [[Boleyn cave system]], ruled by the Hive Queen [[Dacre]].
They plagued the land for several centuries, enslaving many people to their will.
During the war against the [[Lek'qer]], [[Lord Theodore Nott]] and [[Lord Edward Dragonvale]] managed to draw out [[Farnor|one of these beholders]] and capture it, which they used to great effect in the war.
The effects of the beholders continued to expand until they had several towns enslaved to their will.
When [[Miyatol Dodonus]] traveled to this land, he helped a town fight off one of these beholders, he enlisted the help of the [[Richard Iwaelfhem|High Sorcerer Richard]] and his wife, the [[Lucy Iwaelfhem|arch-fey Lucy]] and returned to drive away these beholders. In a great battle, Miyatol was able to strike the finishing blow on Queen Dacre, and the beholders scattered across the land.
