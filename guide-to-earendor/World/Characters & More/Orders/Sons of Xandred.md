Sons of Xandred are a group established by [[Xandred Valerius]], [[Sebastian De Clairmont|Sebastian Valerious]]. 

They worked to obtain his means and goals, of all sorts, including working in the slave trade in secret in order to provide constant sacrifice of life force to sustain Xandred.

They began dealing with the Cherhai in order to do this.

They created a monopoly on [[Stellatite]] mines and ran the mines with slave labour, and began running slaving raids in the north and engaging more deeply in the trade for greater profit, paying off politicians. When a local sorcerer of considerable power, Kalquend, noticed, they placed a large bounty on his head and had him killed.[^1]

Leading up to the Longest Night, they deeply increased the mining so they could provide weapons to [[Asmodeus]]. [^2]
