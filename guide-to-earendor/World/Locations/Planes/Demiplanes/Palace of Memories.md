The Palace of Memories is a demiplane woven from the very fabric of the Shadowfell. It is a sanctuary for memories and stories, which [[Araushnee]] hoards obsessively since the loss of her son. The palace was been shattered by [[Asmodeus]] during the Sundered War but it was restored by The Raven Queen afterwards.

After the Sundering War, the Raven Queen, her power restored but her soul forever scarred, returned to her Palace of Memories in the Shadowfell. There, she continued her eternal vigil over memories and stories, a bittersweet sanctuary amidst the chaos.

In her self-imposed exile, the Raven Queen resides in this palace, preserving memories and stories from various locations of Earendor. She is a goddess who guards over these memories and stories. The Palace of Memories serves as a sanctuary for memories and stories, but it also represents sorrow because of how the Raven Queen hoards them obsessively.
