# The Fountains of Creation (Plane of Magma)

## Introduction

The Fountains of Creation, also known as the Plane of Magma, is a unique and awe-inspiring realm situated at the confluence of the [[Undying Pyre]] and the [[Caverns of Stillness]]. This plane embodies the raw power of creation and transformation, where the fiery essence of the Undying Pyre melds with the solid resilience of the Caverns of Stillness.

## Geography and Landscape

### The Magma Rivers
The most striking feature of the Fountains of Creation is its vast rivers of molten lava and magma. These rivers flow with a life of their own, carving pathways through the plane and creating a landscape that is constantly reshaped by their fiery passage.

### The Crystal Forests
Amidst the flowing magma, crystal forests rise, formed from the cooled and solidified elements. These crystal formations vary in size and shape, ranging from towering spires to intricate, delicate structures that seem to defy the harsh conditions of their surroundings.

### The Obsidian Fields
Where the lava cools and solidifies, vast fields of obsidian stretch across the landscape. These fields are treacherous, with sharp edges and unstable grounds, but they are also home to unique flora and fauna adapted to this environment.

## Ecology

### Fire and Earth Elementals
The Fountains of Creation is inhabited by both fire and earth elementals. These beings embody the dual nature of the plane, some born from molten rock, others from the flames themselves.

### Magma Creatures
Unique to this plane are the magma creatures, beings that have adapted to live in the rivers of flowing lava. These creatures vary in size and form but share a common ability to withstand and navigate the extreme temperatures of their habitat.

### Crystal Fauna and Flora
In the cooler regions, especially around the Crystal Forests, a variety of crystalline plants and creatures can be found. These beings have evolved to incorporate the minerals of the plane into their very biology.

## Role in the Cosmos

### A Site of Power
The Fountains of Creation are not just a geographical marvel; they are a nexus of elemental power. This plane is often sought out by powerful beings, such as [[Istishia]] and [[Telos]], for its raw energy and potential for creation.

### A Forge of Artifacts
Due to its unique properties, the plane serves as an ideal forge for powerful artifacts. The combination of fire and earth energies makes it possible to create items imbued with both stability and transformational energy.

## Influence on Other Planes

### Connection to the Undying Pyre and Caverns of Stillness
The Fountains of Creation acts as a bridge between the fiery Undying Pyre and the solid Caverns of Stillness, influencing both planes with its combined energies.

## Conclusion
