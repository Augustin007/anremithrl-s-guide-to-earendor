# Frostfell: The Paraelemental Plane of Ice and Cold

## Origin

The realm of Frostfell was born from the bitterness and rejection felt by [[Dur-baagal|Dur-baagal the Cold and Cruel]]. Spurned by [[Akadi|Akadi the Gentle]] and [[Istishia|Istishia the Terrible]], Dur-baagal retreated to the space between their elemental planes, creating a realm of ice and cold that mirrors his own heart. Dur-baagal once resided in the Frozen Fortress, from where he ruled his domain with a cold hand, it was from there,  sitting on the Throne of Ice. that he commanded the Elohim, and there where he first retreated to, until [[Atropus]] pursued him.

It borders the [[Gentle Zephyr]] and the [[Cresting Spires]], for those who can walk between planes.
## Geography

Frostfell is a frigid wasteland, a realm of endless snow and ice. Towering glaciers, frozen lakes, and snow-covered mountains dominate the landscape. The realm is divided into several regions:

- **The Frozen Sea**: A vast ocean of ice, where the water has been stilled by the cold.
- **The Shivering Mountains**: A range of snow-capped peaks, home to various ice creatures.
- **The Glacial Forest**: A forest of ice, where even the trees are frozen in time.

## Inhabitants

The realm is home to a variety of ice-based creatures, from the lowly ice mephit to the mighty frost giants. These are creatures that have slipped through the [[Trees of Sanctuary]] and made their way to the neighboring Paraelemental plane.

## Magic and Resources

The realm is rich in ethereal ice, a substance that can be used in various magical rituals and spells. However, the extreme cold makes it a dangerous place for the unprepared. Many a mage has met their end seeking the realm's resources.

## Role before the Mortal Ages

During the age of the Primordials, Frostfell was largely ignored by the other realms. However, as the Eternal Wars began, its strategic importance became evident, for Dur-baagal had made of it a great fortress. [[Auril]] took over the fortress after the Eternal Wars, for she had slain [[Dur-baagal]] and many considered it her spoils. During the Sundered War it was nearly impossible to take, and the might of the [[Righteous Council]] could not easily overcome that of the [[Betrayer Gods]] when they hid there at the end of the war, and indeed they would have survived had it not been for the treason of [[Orcus]].
