# The Great Conflagration: The Paraelemental Plane of Fire and Air

## Origin

The Great Conflagration was born from the eternal dance between the two siblings, [[Akadi|Akadi the Gentle]] and [[Istishia|Kossuth the Eternal Flame]]. Where the Gentle Zephyr meets the Undying Pyre, their elemental energies intertwine, giving birth to a realm of ceaseless firestorms and tempestuous winds. It is a place where the essence of both planes melds into a chaotic symphony of heat and motion.

For those who can traverse the elemental realms, the Great Conflagration is connected to the [[Gentle Zephyr]] and the [[Undying Pyre]]

## Geography

The Great Conflagration is a realm of ever-changing landscapes, where cyclones of fire whirl across expansive skies and gusts of heated air sweep through valleys of flame. The realm is divided into several regions:

- **The Ember Skies**: A sky ablaze with swirling fire, where the winds themselves are alight.
- **The Searing Plains**: Flat expanses of molten rock and flame, constantly reshaped by the winds.

## Inhabitants

The Great Conflagration is home to a myriad of fire and air-based creatures. Species like the Pyrodrakes and Wind Wraiths have evolved here. Many of their ancestors found their way here before the [[Trees of Sanctuary]].

## Magic and Resources

The realm is abundant in elemental fire and air, which can be harnessed for potent magical rituals and spells. The ever-changing nature of the plane makes it a challenging but rewarding place for those seeking to tap into its elemental power.
