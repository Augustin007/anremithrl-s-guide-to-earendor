# The Dark Regions: The Quasi-Plane Between Realms

## Introduction

The Dark Regions are a mysterious and enigmatic quasi-plane that exists between the [[Ethereal Plane]] and the [[Abyss]].
## Origin

The Dark Regions were always a dark place, but they truly became as they were as a byproduct of the cosmic machinations of [[Atropus]], the Elder Evil, and his malevolent endeavors. Atropus, after being whispered to by [[Shar]], sought to bring about entropy and decay. His actions led to the corruption of this quasi-plane, which is imbued with pure negative energy.

## Geography

The Dark Regions are not a plane in the traditional sense; rather, they are a chaotic amalgamation of swirling dark energies and ethereal mists. The landscape is ever-changing, with no stable landmarks to guide travelers. It is a realm where time itself is distorted, thanks to the influence of [[Dur-baagal]], the Cold and Cruel.

## Inhabitants

The Dark Regions are largely uninhabited due to their inhospitable nature. However, they are not entirely devoid of life. Various malevolent entities, originating from the Abyss, find solace in this realm. These entities, messengers from Shar, are transient, using the Dark Regions as a passageway between the Ethereal Plane and the Abyss.

## Connection to Other Planes

The Dark Regions serve as a bridge between the Ethereal Plane and the Abyss. They are often used as a conduit for dark energies and malevolent entities to pass between these two planes.
