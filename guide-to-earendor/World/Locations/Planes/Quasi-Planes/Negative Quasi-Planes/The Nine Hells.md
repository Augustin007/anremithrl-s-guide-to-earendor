A quasi-plane formed between the [[Abyss]] and the [[Material Plane]]


The nine hells:

1. [[Dis]]: A labyrinthine city of iron, home to the [[Archduke Dispater]]. It is a place of treachery and deceit.
2. Minauros: A bog of eternal stench and rain, overseen by the [[Archduke Mammon]] and [[Tiamat]]. It is a place of greed and avarice.
3. Phlegethos: A realm of fire and molten lava, ruled by [[Belial]] and [[Fierna]]. It embodies wrath and cruelty.
4. Stygia: A frozen wasteland surrounding a dark sea, ruled by [[Levistus]]. It is a place of sorrow and betrayal. It is here the [[River Styx]] flows
5. Malbolge: A mountainous realm of shifting landscapes, overseen by [[Glasya]]. It is a place of manipulation and cunning.
6. Maladomini: A decaying, polluted realm, ruled by [[Ba'al'zebul]]. It is a place of lies and politics.
7. Cania: A realm of eternal cold and ice, ruled by [[Mephistopheles]]. It is a place of isolation and study of arcane arts.
8. Nessus: A barren wasteland of despair. It serves as the front line in the Blood War, a never-ending conflict between devils and demons. Ruled by Nessus.
9. Avernus: The deepest layer, a realm of utter darkness and evil, ruled by [[Asmodeus]] himself. It is the seat of ultimate power and corruption.
