The Caverns of Stillness are a mysterious and secluded realm, hidden deep within the fabric of the Universe. Governed by [[Grumbar]], the Elemental Sibling of Earth, these caverns serve as a sanctuary for those who seek respite from the chaos of the Eternal Wars. 

The Root Hold in the Caverns was the home of [[Ubtao]] before he was slain, and [[Akadi]] would often leave the [[Gentle Zephyr]] to meet with him there.

[[Dur-baagal]]'s disruption of Time makes time flow much more slowly in the Caverns of Stillness.

During the Eternal Wars, the Caverns of Stillness served as a strategic hideout for Grumbar and the Cosmic Twins, [[Arambar]] and [[Asgorath]]. It was here that they regrouped and planned their counterattacks, safe from the prying eyes of their enemies.

The Caverns resonate with the force that binds things to the solid state, for Grumbar was the first to create the elements, and when he made them they did not move much, but stayed still. making them a place of great power for those who can tap into elemental forces. This resonance also provides a natural barrier against intrusions from other elemental planes.

The greatest treasure of the Caverns is the [[Heartstone]], which Grumbar guards fiercely.

Beyond this, the wizard and plane-walker [[Iskandar]] hid the [[Tome of Silence]] here. 

For those who can walk between planes, the Caverns of Stillness are connected to the Paraelemental Planes:
  [[Swamp of Oblivion]]
  [[Fountains of Creation]]
  [[Floating Mountains]]

And the Quasi Planes
  [[The Richest Depths]]
  [[The Unending Dustcloud]]
  [[The Bogs of Quicksand]]
  [[The Crystal Caves]]
