The Undying Pyre, also known as the Plane of Fire, is a realm of vibrant combustion and radiant flames. Governed by [[Istishia]], the Elemental Sibling of Fire, this plane is a canvas of ever-changing hues and luminous beauty. It is a place where rivers of molten lava meander through towering mountains of fire, and where the air is alive with the colors of countless flames.

In a harmonious balance, the air within the Undying Pyre is rich and abundant, a gift from [[Akadi]], the Elemental Sibling of Air. The two share a deep friendship, for does not fire always need air to fuel it? This unique relationship makes the plane a spectacle of breathtaking beauty, where flames dance in a myriad of colors, illuminating the wonders of the realm.

[[Telos]] and [[Nehusta]] were great friends of Kossuth, and they built in the Plane of Fire many different wonders before the Eternal Wars.

Due to [[Dur-baagal]]'s manipulation of Time, the vibrant flames within the plane sometimes behave in unpredictable ways, yet their beauty remains undiminished, making the Undying Pyre a realm of awe even for the most experienced plane-walkers.

During the Eternal Wars, Kossuth collaborated closely with [[Telos]] and [[Nehusta]], crafting artifacts and wonders of immense power. Among these is the [[Sword of Eons]], a weapon imbued with the essence of the plane itself, and the [[Flameheart]], a gem of pure fire that Kossuth guards with great care.

The plane resonates with the elemental forces of combustion and transformation, as well as the life-giving qualities of air. Those who can tap into these elemental energies find their abilities magnified in this realm of fire and air.
