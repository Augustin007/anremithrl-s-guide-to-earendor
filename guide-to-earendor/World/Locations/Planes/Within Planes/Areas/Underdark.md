The Underdark of Eärendor is a sprawling, complex realm of darkness and danger, woven intricately into the lore and geography of the world above. Far beneath the surface, extending deep into the bowels of the earth, it presents a grim tableau of survival, hostility, and enigmatic beauty. This vast underground network is not only a setting for tales of horror and adventure but also a living, breathing entity within the lore.

### Overview of the Underdark
The Underdark is a subterranean world that lies deep beneath the kingdoms and landscapes of the surface. It is a place where the absence of light and goodness breeds a unique and often terrifying ecosystem. Here, the rules of the surface do not apply, and the creatures that dwell in this eternal darkness have evolved in isolation, developing strange and formidable abilities.

The Underdark in Eärendor is accessible through several known entrances, most notably in the city of Bremen. Tunnels beneath this city lead deep into the Underdark, hinting at a sprawling network of caverns and pathways that connect distant and isolated locales across the realm.

### Geography and Layers of the Underdark
The Underdark is divided into three primary layers, each descending deeper and growing more perilous:

1. **Upperdark**: The closest layer to the surface. The highest tunnels of the underdark reach to three miles bellow the surface. None but the dwarves have caved that deep. It serves as the most common interface between the surface dwellers and the Underdark's denizens. Here, the paths of adventurers and traders intersect with those from below, resulting in exchanges both hostile and peaceful.

2. **Middledark**: Located between 4 and 13 miles below the surface, this layer houses most of the Underdark's sprawling cities. It is a zone of relative civilization amid the chaos, where commerce and political intrigue thrive in the great drow cities and duergar fortresses.

3. **Lowerdark**: Extending 13 miles or deeper, the Lowerdark is a realm so perilous that even seasoned explorers of the Underdark hesitate to venture into it. Home to the most fearsome creatures and profound mysteries, it is a place of legend and dread.

### Climate and Environment
The climate of the Underdark is remarkably stable compared to the surface, generally remaining cool and damp. The deeper layers near thermal vents can be warmer, but the overall lack of sunlight creates a uniformly dim and chilly environment. Water sources within the Underdark are icy cold, posing additional hazards to the unwary.

### Flora and Fauna
The absence of sunlight has led to a unique biosphere. Plant life, such as various fungi and mosses, thrives by deriving energy from minerals and the ambient folds in the weave. This magic-infused environment supports a diverse range of life forms, from simple insects to formidable predators like hook horrors and shadow dragons.
### Inhabitants
The Underdark is home to a myriad of races, each adapted to the harsh realities of subterranean life. These include, but are not limited to, aboleths, beholders, cloakers, derro, drow, duergar, illithids, kuo-toa, quaggoths, and svirfneblin. These beings form complex societies and often engage in intricate political machinations, both against each other and against intruders from the surface.

### Lore
Little is known about the Underdark in the history and mythology of Eärendor. From the legendary tales of heroes like [[Miyatol Dodonus]], who learned of dark dealings and barely escaped, to the dread presence of entities like the[[ Dracolich of Karr]], the Underdark influences the surface world in profound ways.

In the tales of Eärendor, the Underdark is a symbol of the unknown, representing the depths of both the earth and the soul. It is a place where the bravest dare to tread and where the darkness mirrors the absence of goodness, creating a perfect setting for tales of valor, treachery, and the eternal struggle between light and shadow.

[[Brundar Deepmine]], a Dwarven geologist from the city of Torin's Gate, was instrumental in establishing early connections between the Overworld and the Underdark.

### Notable Locations and Inhabitants
**Ashdilkir's Library**: One of the most enigmatic sites in the Underdark is the hidden library of [[Ashdilkir]], located in the caves deep beneath Bremen. This library contains over thirty-thousand years of memories from Ashdilkir, who, having lost her sanity and memory, recorded everything she could recall. This makes the library a treasure trove of ancient knowledge and forgotten histories.

**The Dracolich of Karr**: The Dracolich of Karr is a fearsome resident of the Underdark, known for its terrifying presence and lethal capabilities. Created to guard the left hand of [[Vecna]], a powerful artifact, this dracolich is a formidable foe with dark scales, a massive wingspan, and glowing red eyes. Its intelligence and cunning make it a deadly adversary for any who dare to venture too close.
