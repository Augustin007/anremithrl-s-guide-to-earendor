The Dol Garoth Prison is a high security complex located in [[Velurk]] in [[Neros]]. It is a large prison equipped with powerful and complex antimagic systems and state-of-the-art technology for locking down the most powerful of sorcerers and mages. 
The prison is divided into several sections, each housing different types of prisoners. The most notorious prisoners are held in the deepest and darkest section called "Section X". This section is heavily guarded by the most experienced guards and is only accessible to a select few officials.

The Great Escape
When one of the prisoners claimed to know the location of the [[Oathbreaker Sword]], a sword sharp enough to cut through the bonds of unbreakable vows. 
This caught the attention of the politician and sorcerer [[Tormac]], who also was a secret member of the council of [[The Greenclad]], a guild of assassins, and a warlock of [[Tiamat]].
The great political influence of [[Tormac]], along with his fortune, allowed him to have several greenclad infiltrate the place over the course of five years. This cost Tormac the majority of his wealth, but he was capable to get three men in there. He then payed a powerful necromancer who had fled the law to get caught, and with his men was able to temporarily deactivate the antimagic runes. This lasted for a fraction of a millisecond. Almost immediately, the facility was closing down, and Tormac's men were caught. The necromancer was prepared and timed a good burst of magic for that exact moment, managing to counter the reapplication of the antimagic for a little longer. With this he was able to summon an army of skeletons which quickly took out the guards and began unlocking all the other cells. 
The alarm was raised within two seconds.
Within twenty-four seconds, by which time twelve prisoners from section X, including the target, were free, the summoned army was banished, but the prisoners managed to continue the process of freeing the rest.

Two minutes later, military reinforcements arrived and tried to fight them down. After a great battle, the necromancer was recaptured, but fifty-three prisoners, including the target, escaped.

Within five days, all but four were recaptured. 

In twelve days, all but two had been found.

The target was found dead one month later, outside the gates.
