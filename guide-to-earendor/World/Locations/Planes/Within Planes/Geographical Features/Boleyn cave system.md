The Boleyn cave system is located in [[Swanward]], a kingdom known for its rugged terrain and abundant natural resources. The cave system itself is vast, stretching across multiple levels and connecting to other areas of the kingdom.

The cave system was once home to a group of beholders known as the [[Beholders of Swanward]]. The Hive Queen, named [[Dacre]], ruled over this group with an iron fist. They were responsible for maintaining the balance of power within Earendor and ensuring that no other creature dared trespass on their territory.

The Hive was destroyed by [[Miyatol Dodonus]], [[Richard Iwaelfhem]], and [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]].

Beholders still roam these caves and they are considered dangerous.
