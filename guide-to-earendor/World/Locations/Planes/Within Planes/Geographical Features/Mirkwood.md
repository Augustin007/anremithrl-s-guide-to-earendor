Mirkwood is an ancient forest that spans across much of Eärendor, located in the eastern region of the continent. It is known for its dense foliage and darkened sky, giving it its name. The area was once a lush and thriving forest, but over time, it became overgrown with flora and fauna of its own creation. This change happened when [[Sarnor]], an arch-fae of great power, turned the forest into his playground. He created all kinds of dangerous creatures that preyed on anyone who dared to enter the area.

After some time, [[Lucy Iwaelfhem]], a young fairy girl, considered by all she met to be the greatest beauty of the feywild, was drawn towards it because of its dark power. She approached Sarnor with an offer to join his cause, and though he did not think she was powerful enough to help him, he accepted her offer because he was filled with desire for her. However, she managed to impress him with her great power.

The two filled Mirkwood with dangerous creatures that he created himself, inspired by the aberrations of [[Shar]]. 

Lucy eventually was captured and Sarnor abandoned her and continued his work alone.

When Lucy returned, she was no longer attracted to his evil and power, she succeeded in defeating Sarnor and restored Mirkwood to its former glory. She managed to undo all of the evil that they had done during his reign over the forest.
