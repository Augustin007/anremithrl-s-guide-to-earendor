(Beyond time and space there is only a sense of causation, not of beginning or end. Everything is all at once in a "stable" manner.)
Little is known about beyond time and space, or what is beyond even that, if there is a beyond. But it is known that Ao and Isfet are not the 'first cause', but rather, they were caused. And other entities dwell beyond time and space beyond our comprehension. 
Ao and Isfet are _caused_. They are the King of Order and the Queen of Chaos. And they were caused at all times, or no times, everywhere and nowhere.

(In almost time, time and space are curved and bundled. Within it, there is no sense of continous time and space, but there is a sense of _next_. Of spending moments together. It was caused by Ao and Isfet, and things that enter or exit will be present at all points of it, and join again at any point 'next' to leaving, but only be one continuous presence outside of it. While beyond time and space order is supreme, in this almost time and space, chaos is more powerful. The overlappings aren't perfect. Almost time exists in some places where almost space doesn't, and vice versa.)

And they, in turn, caused almost-time and almost space, and they entered it, so that they may spend some time of it together.
In the almost-time and space, things formed. And they swirled and moved. They were one way then another. And it was beautiful and fascinating.
And Ao and Isfet wished to perfect it. But they could not. 
From their union emerged first Selûne and Shar, the twins of light and darkness. These are the first beings to have a beginning, the first beings that could ever have an end.
And in the very next that was, Asgorath and Arambar emerged, and unlike Selune and Shar, they were enamoured with time and space, and they wished to perfect it, for those were the desires that they had. They were more ephemeral and moody. Ever changing, but loved creation and order. The Cosmic Twins were more powerful than their elder sisters. They saw the work of the others and perfected it. Time and space as it is. Within the bounds of almost time and almost space, they create structures that hold it together and stable. They formed the Universe, an Aether, a substance which dragged things within it, causing a continuum. Infinite dimensions of freedom and movement. 

And Ao and Isfet could not enter it, for they had no beginning or end.

Four others emerged in this era, in this order: Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akida. And these are the Primordials of the Dawn. The children of Chaos and Order, before they retreated from the almost-was. 

Selune and Shar settled on the ends of the almost and the was. Selune had proper space, but only almost time. Her light was eternal and undying. Everpresent. Shar had time, but only almost space, and her land was called the Abyss, for her darkness and evil filled it all.

Arambar and Azgorath, in true time and space, formed of Aether the borders of the planes, and made five true planes. Five homes. One for the two of them, and one for Grumbar, Istishia, Kossuth, and Akida. And the planes burgeoned fractaly, and created other planes and pockets and demiplanes and quasiplanes. 

Others emerged, then. Even more ephemeral and less powerful. Here emerged Ubtao and Atropus and Durbagaal, Talos and Nehusta.  Those that emerged in this time are named the Primordials of the Dusk. 
The most notable, from that pushing of the universe against the almost was emerged Tartarus, and he was the greatest of the Dusk.
There emerged lesser beings, too. With swift beginnings and ends. And the primordials ignored them. These were the Aetherborn. And from them came those that call themselves githzerai and githyanki, which were more corporeal. Their minds were not truly distinct, but psionically held between them, and they did not die quite as mortals did, for their bodies were not important. But all the same they had beginnings and ends. 

From the Dusk, the Children of the Dusk were created. Stewards of their creations and homes. Servants. Some of lesser and some of greater power. 

Talos and Nehusta in this time unite and create the Elessar, known as the first of the gods.

Time as it was then is difficult to measure or to count. But it is thought to be at least on the order of a few hundred thousand years ago while others say millions or even trillions of years ago. 

---
The Eternal Wars begin then. In this time, primordials were unmade and scattered and wounded. 
The Elohim and the Celestials are created. 
As are the Epic Dragons primordial creations meant to wipe out creation itself.

The scattered remnants of gods clung to things that were and are, and created the Genasi, it is of these peoples also that the Tritons are.

In the end, the gods ruled the world. Though many say the war is not over, but only in brief interlude. 


~100,000 BS (estimated vary deeply)
The gods tore the fifth plane, that the home of Azgorath and Arambar, and created out of it a sixth true plane, a prison to hold the epic dragons and azgorath trapped in it's bindings. They did this with the help of the four elemental primordials. A plane filled with matter. A plane most closely tied to time and space. In it, galaxies and stars and things began to form.

~10,000 BS: The Age of Awakening
The first life, trees and animals come to be. Elves and Ents are the first sentient beings to be created. Whether the Unknown Name (The God of Death) or the Hidden Name (The being of unknown origin, which often is called the god of Death/Marriage, but isn't properly a god. Marethyu in early language means death and marriage, and that is what he is often called) created them, scholars differ.  The Astral Plane is created for the souls of the dead. 
Humans are the secondborn. As a few other gods pick it up, others are created. These are the prominent species. Dwarves, halflings, and goliaths. 
Akida creates the Aarakocra and the Aven. The other primordials in their own planes create some of their own life. plasmoids.

dhampirs - People who sought immortality in the dark regions
goblins, orcs, trolls, hobgoblin, verdan are created by gods who want to be entertained by raids and wars.
Some species go deep underground to avoid the notice of the gods. Some gods still notice them all the same. This begins the formation of the underdark.
~Age of Kingdoms
The interference lessens as Thalorin, The Unknown Name, and the Hidden Name speak before the council. Though they are punished for bringing the Hidden Name into the home of the gods, Thalorin and the Unknown Name do begin a movement against harming mortals or using them as slaves or servants. Toying with them.

He used it to formalise the idea of 'unknowns' and what to do if there was more than one thing that was not known.

The Age of Rising (~3000 BS):
Later tribes and kingdoms begin to form. Larger kingdoms like the Ardwedili and Narheth.

Early spells were beginning to be written down in this time. Noteably, "On Magic" by the Elessar Elian. Physics ideas of aether, time, and planes begin to form in this time as well. Models for how it all interacts. Ideas of magical energy begin to occur. Many scientific ideas of this time are compiled by Tarnis in his writing titled "True Planes and Stuff"
Rondar was a mathematical prodigy who spent his life developing number theory much further, developing concepts of sets, classes, and categories. He lived through the Sundered War and was Tal'berius's , Garrett, and Artorius's teacher.
Artorius and Tal were brothers and both incredibly intelligent, though Artorius was always kinder than Tal'berius. They were both students of Rondar, and pushed his ideas even further. Artorius did not have Tal'berius's raw magical talent, but they both liked making things explode and were fascinated by magical items and artifice, to Rondar's (who had no magic, and did not consider it much) disaproval. (Artorius would die fighting Vecna during the Sundered War)
Garrett was an early inventor of magical gadgets, blending rudimentary engineering with enchantments. He studied first with Rondar, but could not keep up, and later apprenticed himself to the brothers Tal'berius and Artorius.
Twelve years before the sundering war, Tal'berius and Artorius's Codex Arcanum strongly argued that knowledge of logic was foundational for studying the Arcane. They included an introduction to logic in the text, as well as one-hundred and twenty pages introducing alchemy and artifice, four-hundred and forty-five mathematical proofs, eighteen pages on categorisation of different magics, sources of magics, types of magic, and natures of it, arguing (correctly) psionic talents were not of the same nature as magic, and a compilation of "Three hundred spells of usefulness for sorcerers learning to reign in their powers", which were descriptions of how each spell worked, how it felt to cast it, and recommendations on imprinting and moving the spell around, including early rune theory, and mathematics related to the spell. They created early calculation and mathematics spells with divination and introduced the concept of a limit. They also added a section on his new idea, "Constructs", and wrote another hundred pages outlining early algorithmic theory and how you could create spells that could follow logically well-defined instructions to automate more vast processes.
